GB/T 2312 - 1980 \"Character Set for Information Exchange Using Chinese Characters\" Basic Set GB/I 11383.1-1989 Information Processing \"Eight-bit Code Structure and Coding Rules for Information Exchange\" GB/Industry 13000 General Multi-Eight-Bit Encoding Character Set (UCS) for Information Technology 3 Terms and Definitions The following terms and definitions apply to this document. 3.1 Character An element in a set of elements used to organize, control, or represent data. 3.2 Coded Character Character (3.1) and its encoding representation. 3.3 Private Use Area A user-defined area that can be specified by users of products that comply with this document. 3.4 Vocabulary repertoire A specified set of characters (3.1) represented by a set of encoded characters (3.2). 3.5 Reserved zone Reserved for the area specified in this document for future use. GB 18030-2022 4 Vocabulary 4.1 Overview The characters included in this document are encoded in single-byte, double-byte, or four-byte formats. The single-byte section includes all 128 characters from 0x00 to 0x7F of GB/T 11383-1989. 4.3 Double-byte section The double-byte section includes all graphic characters from GB/T 2312-1980, the CJK Unified Ideographs from GB/T 13000, as well as some graphic characters. The characters in the double-byte section are specified according to Appendix A. Among them, the graphics, code positions, and functions of the ideographic character descriptors should comply with the provisions of Appendix B. Note: GB/T 13000 is a unified encoding for Chinese characters used in countries and regions such as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Chinese characters with unique abstract glyphs are assigned separate code positions; characters with the same abstract glyph but different origins are assigned shared code positions. The encoded Chinese characters are referred to as CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea. 4.4 Four-byte section The four-byte section includes 66 CJK Unified Ideographs from GB/T 13000 that are not part of the aforementioned double-byte characters (from 9FA6 to 9FEF, excluding the 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB), as well as CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F, and characters from minority languages that have already been encoded in GB/T 13000. The characters in the four-byte section are specified according to Appendix C. 5 Overall Structure In the main text, numbers marked with 0x are in hexadecimal, while those not marked with 0x are in decimal. In the appendix, all representations of codes are in hexadecimal, while other numbers are represented in decimal. The single-byte section uses the encoding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, utilizing the code points from 0x00 to 0x7F. The double-byte section uses two eight-bit binary strings to represent a character, with the first byte code points ranging from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the second byte code points ranging from 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE, respectively. The four-byte section uses the unused 0x30 to 0x39 from GB/T 11383-1989 as suffixes for the expansion of double-byte encoding, with the encoding range from 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39. The encoding range for the first byte of a four-byte character is from 0x81 to 0xFE; the encoding range for the second byte is from 0x30 to 0x39; the encoding range for the third byte is from 0x81 to 0xFE; and the encoding range for the fourth byte is from 0x30 to 0x39. That is: 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239; 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39. The overall structure and code point range allocation can be found in Figure 1 and Table 1. The arrangement order of 6 characters. 6.1 The arrangement order of characters in the single-byte section. The characters in the single-byte section are arranged according to the order of the corresponding characters in GB/T 11383-1989. 6.2 The arrangement order of certain characters in double-byte city parts. The arrangement order of the characters in the lower part of the double-byte should comply with Appendix A. 6.3 The arrangement order of certain characters in the four-byte brush part. From 0x81308130 to 0x8439FE39, there are a total of 50,400 code points, corresponding to all characters in the GB/T 13000 Basic Multilingual Plane that are not included in the double-byte part, arranged in the order of the corresponding characters in the GB/T 13000 Basic Multilingual Plane. From 0x90308130 to 0xE339FE39, a total of 1,058,400 code points are used for the 16 supplementary planes of GB/T 13000, with the character arrangement order completely following the corresponding code point order of the 16 supplementary planes of GB/I 13000. The arrangement order of the characters in the four-byte part should comply with Appendix C. 7 Code Point Allocation 1. Code Point Allocation for Single-Byte City Parts The code points of the single-byte part are allocated according to the rules of GB/T 11383-1989. See Figure 2 for single-byte code point allocation. 2. Code position allocation for double-character sections. The code position arrangement for the double-byte section is divided into two parts: 0x8140 to 0xFE7E and 0x8180 to 0xFEFE, totaling 23,940 code positions. The allocation of double-byte code positions can be found in Figure 3 and Table 2. Total: 23,940 code positions. Double-byte Area 1: 846 code positions.

Note:  The standard Chinese character encoding used in China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and other nations and regions is called GB/T 13000. Chinese characters with distinctive abstract glyphs are given their own code positions, while characters with the same abstract glyph but from various sources are given a similar code position. CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea, and the encoded Chinese characters are referred to as CJK unified Chinese characters or CCJK Unified Ideographs. 4.4 Four-byte part The text lists various Chinese characters in different standards, including GB/T 13000, .CJK unified character extensions A and C/D, and expansions. The characters in the four-byte section adhere to Appendix C's rules. 5 Overall structure The text uses hexadecimal notation for integers marked with a 0x, whereas decimal notation is used for values without a 0x. The appendix's codes are all expressed in hexadecimal, while decimal is used for all other values. The single-byte portion uses the GB/T 11383-1989 encoding scheme and the code points 0x00–0x7F. 1st byte: 0x81-0xFE, last byte: 0x40-0x7E, 0x80-0xFE double-word component uses two 8-bit binary strings for each letter. The coding range for the four-byte component is 0x81308130-0xFE39FE39, while the suffix used to expand the double-byte code is 0x30-0x39, which was not utilized in GB/Work 11383-1989. The first character of a four-byte character has an encoding range of 0x81-0xFE; the second character's range is 0x30-0x39; the third byte's range is 0x81-0xFE; and the fourth character's range is 0x30 A 0x39. Right now: 0x81308130-0x81308139; 0x81308230-0x81308239 0x8130FEFE30-0x8130FE39; 0x81318130-0x81318139; Oo2douolag0c \"0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30-0xFE39FE39. Figure 1 and Table 1 display the general organization and allocation of code point ranges. 6 character character sort order 6.1 Character placement in single-character brushes: certain characters' order Certain characters in single-character remarks are organized in the same sequence as their GB/I 11383-1989 counterparts. Double characters are ordered. The lower half of the double word's characters should be arranged in line with Appendix A. 6.3 The four-character brush's character arrangement There are 50400 code points in GB/T 13000 for single-byte characters, organized in the same order as the double-byte ones, Chars: 0x81308130 - 0x8439FE39.gly The 16 auxiliary planes of GB/T 13000 are represented by a total of 1,058,400 code bits from 0x90308130 to 0xE339FE39, and the character arrangement order is exactly in line with the equivalent code bit order of the 16 auxiliary planes of GB/I 13000. The four-byte part's character order must adhere to Appendix C. 7 Code point allocation 1. The single-character city part's code point allocation According to the guidelines in GB/T 11383-1989, the code points for the single-byte component are assigned. The distribution of single-byte code points is shown in Figure 2. Code distribution for double word section. The double-byte part's code bit layout is split into two sections with a combined 23940 code bits each: 0x8140-0xFE7E and 0x8180-0xFEFE. For the allocation of double-byte code points, see Figure 3 and Table 2.

Note that certain combinations of options (for example, `-x cpp-output -E`) will cause GCC to compile or assemble the source files.

In contrast, a freestanding environment does not have a standard library, and the program entry point is not necessarily main; the most obvious example is an operating system kernel. For more details, refer to the latest information on the GCC website.) For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo();`, they are treated in a C-style manner—meaning that the number or types of parameters are not specified. (This applies only to C++.) Normally, such a function `foo` in C++ means that the parameters are empty. The list of features ranges from here to attempts to support certain aspects of traditional C compilers. For details, please refer to the NU C manual; we have removed the specifics so that people won't be misled when the content becomes outdated. Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option has an additional effect that allows assignment to this. It is the same as the effect of the `-Ethis-is-variable' option. -traditional-cpp attempts to support certain aspects of the traditional C preprocessor. In particular, the content mentioned above regarding the preprocessor, but excluding the other effects of the `-traditional' option. -fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the `$' character in identifiers (only for C++). You can specify the `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the `$' symbol. (GNU C++ allows the `$' symbol by default on certain target systems, but not on all systems.) -fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from any type to enumeration type (MEF C++). Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around. The -fexternal-templates option generates smaller code for template declarations (limited to C++) by creating only one copy of each template function at the location where they are defined. To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation` (definition) or `#pragma interface` (declaration) in all files that use templates. When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates`, all template instantiations are of external types. You must ensure that the required instances appear in the implementation files. This can be achieved through typedef, which references each required instance. Conversely, if the default option `-fno-external-templates` is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set as internal. All member functions (except for constructors and the new or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to. This does not imply that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table. In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it will call it directly. The -fcond-mismatch option allows the types of the second and third parameters of a conditional expression to be mismatched. The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable, which allows assignment to this (only for C++). After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++, the assignable `this` seems inappropriate. Therefore, by default, assigning to `this` inside class member functions is an invalid operation. However, for backward compatibility, you can enable this operation by using the `-fthis-is-variable` option. The `-funsigned-char` option defines `char` as an unsigned type, similar to `unsigned char`. Different machines have their own default `char` types, which can be either `unsigned char` or `signed char`. Ideally, when relying on the sign of data, a portable program should always use `signed char` or `unsigned char`. However, many programs have been written using only plain `char`, and they expect it to be a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine for which the program was written). This option, along with its opposite option, allows such programs to operate on the corresponding default values. The type of `char` should always be explicitly defined as `signed char` or `unsigned char`, even if it behaves exactly like one of them. If the `signed` or `unsigned` modifier is not explicitly stated, these options are used to define signed or unsigned bitfields. By default, bitfields are signed because they inherit the basic integer type, such as int, which is a signed number. However, if the `-traditional` option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned. The `-fwritable-strings` option stores string constants in a writable data segment without any special treatment. This is to maintain compatibility with some older programs, as they consider modifying string constants to be a very bad idea; the `-traditional` option has the same effect.

Its impact may be similar to the economic crisis of 2008. The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis. In many countries, this disease has overwhelmed healthcare institutions, bringing them to the brink of collapse, and the restrictions implemented by governments have caused severe disruptions in the global economy. The impact of this pandemic on the drug market is still unclear and difficult to predict, but it could have far-reaching effects. Some producers may be forced to seek new methods to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals. Traffickers may have to seek new routes and methods as they are unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions. The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's response capacity may also be hindered. The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but we can still learn some lessons from past crises. After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to seek cheaper synthetic substances, and the pattern of use shifted to injecting drugs. Meanwhile, governments around the world have cut budgets related to drugs. If governments around the world respond to the current economic recession in the same way, interventions such as drug prevention and related risk behavior measures, as well as drug rehabilitation services, may be severely impacted. In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may decrease, making it easier for traffickers to operate. Some countries have a significant amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is expected that the drug trafficking activities in these countries will be the most directly affected. Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their backpacks or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger transport almost everywhere, activities that supply drugs through commercial air travel may be completely disrupted. Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, activities related to trafficking using the dark web and shipping goods may increase. In the long run, economic recession and related lockdown measures may disrupt the drug market. Due to the rising unemployment rate and lack of opportunities, impoverished and vulnerable groups are more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop substance use disorders, and turn to drug-related illegal activities, whether in production or trafficking. Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by offering services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to strengthen their ranks. As the government's capacity to respond diminishes, these changes may quickly take root and become the new reality for many communities. Expansion and Complexity Market Growth The patterns of population growth partially explain the reasons for market expansion. The phenomenon of drug use has been increasing worldwide, both in terms of overall numbers and the proportion of drug users in the global population. In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15 to 64, while in 2018, the estimated number of drug users rose to 269 million, representing 5.3% of this population group. Over the past twenty years, the rate of drug use in developing countries has increased much faster than in developed countries. This reflects, to some extent, the differences in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries. Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users. From 2000 to 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while in developed countries, it decreased by 10%. Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug market. Whether in developed or developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas. One of the reasons for the overall increase in drug use is the large-scale migration of the population from rural to urban areas; currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960. Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where the trend of urbanization is more pronounced. The increase in wealth is associated with a rise in drug use, but it is the poorest people who bear the greatest burden of disease. Globally, drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries. Drugs like cocaine are more strongly associated with the wealthier regions of the world. Similarly, within each country, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the affluent social class. However, the rate of those who develop drug addiction is higher among individuals with lower socioeconomic status. Data from a few countries indicate a correlation between harmful drug use patterns and low income. These patterns seem to be less common among the more affluent social classes. The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users. For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have historically been associated with an increase in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced millions of people worldwide into unemployment. The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market, as more farmers may increase or engage in illegal crop cultivation, either due to reduced control capabilities of national authorities or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities amid the economic crisis. The restrictions related to COVID-19 have led to a decrease in air and land transportation, which may have resulted in an increase in maritime trafficking, as the risks of interception at sea are lower and the volume of smuggling by sea is greater than that by air or land. Recent reports have indicated that cocaine shipments are being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.

The outbreak's impacts on the pharma industry are vague and difficult to estimate, but they may be critical. Due to the constrained get to to antecedents and essential chemicals caused by development confinements, certain makers may be obliged to create modern strategies of medicine generation. Due to travel limitations, traffickers may got to discover elective courses and methods to cross nations. Governments' capacity to respond may be blocked on the off chance that sedate utilize and accessibility designs move. In spite of the fact that the COVID-19 move is bizarre, there are a few lessons to be learned from other emergencies. A few sedate clients begun searching for less costly manufactured drugs amid the 2008 budgetary emergency, and their drug-using propensities changed to sedate infusion. Governments have moreover diminished financing for drug-related programs. Intercessions like medicate utilize and related hazard behavior anticipation and medicate treatment programs may be extremely hurt in the event that governments reacted to the show retreat within the same way.

The destitute and powerless will be more slanted to utilize drugs hurtfully, create sedate utilize disarranges, and lock in in unlawful drug-related activities—whether generation or transportation—as a result of expanded unemployment and a need of openings.

This to some degree reflects the reality that worldwide populace development amid the time shifted between industrialized and creating nations, at 7% and 28%, separately, but it moreover reflects the more youthful populaces in poorer nations developing more rapidly. Youthful individuals and young people account for the larger part of sedate clients. The populace of this age bunch expanded by 16% within the creating world between 2000 and 2018, whereas it shrank by 10% within the created world. One figure driving both the show and future pharmaceutical markets is urbanization Urban zones are more likely than country ones to have a sedate issue, both in created and creating countries. More than half of the world's populace presently lives in urban locales, up from 34% in 1960, and this colossal relocation from rustic to urban regions is to a great extent to fault for the common rise in sedate utilize.

The situation regarding non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but the emergence of new types of opioids with potential harm is increasing, making the drug market increasingly complex. In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing. Member states have approximately 500 new active substances in their domestic markets each year. Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small number of opioids. Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed. Among the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioids accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%. Many of the new psychoactive substances that are opioids are analogs of fentanyl, whose potency and harm have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America, with other regions also affected, though to a lesser extent. In North America, fentanyl is used both as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine) and to manufacture counterfeit prescription opioids. Some evidence suggests that there is also a phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive stimulant substances in Europe: a study of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce stimulating effects. The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly established among vulnerable groups. A single type of new psychoactive substance has almost never formed a large market. However, evidence from Europe indicates that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious issue among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates. Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most of these countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge. The regulation of precursor chemicals forces drug manufacturers to innovate, as many chemicals that are commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamines, methamphetamine, and ecstasy have been placed under international control. Drug traffickers and manufacturers have been seeking alternatives, not only substances with looser regulations but also chemicals specifically designed to evade control, known as \"designer precursors.\" The restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals. Evidence from Mexico indicates that this has become a reality: reports suggest that the shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia in March 2020 led to an increase in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States. The market is constantly changing. Synthetic drugs are replacing opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation. The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018. The quantity of opioids intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has significantly reduced. However, the market for stimulants seems to be thriving. There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methylenedioxypyrovalerone and α-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now ubiquitous in the drug market in Russia. Russian authorities report that the number of secret processing sites for the manufacture of various illegal drugs has sharply increased, more than doubling in two years, rising to 152 sites in 2018. The methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq is growing. As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons, and other institutions revealed the significance of methamphetamine in Iraq. Crystal methamphetamine has become another concerning major drug alongside fentanyl and tramadol. A study conducted in 2015 further confirmed these findings, with drug users indicating that cannabis is harder to obtain than fentanyl or methamphetamine. Recently, Iraqi authorities discovered multiple methamphetamine processing sites, and the narcotics bureau has expressed concern over the large importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, as these processing sites use these preparations as precursors. In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production seems to have started in 2014. Since then, the amount of methamphetamine seized has been steadily increasing. However, the amount seized in the first half of 2019 was 657 kilograms, a significant increase compared to the previous year. A large amount of methamphetamine believed to be sourced from Afghanistan has been seized in other countries, indicating that the country's production is rapidly increasing.

Medicate utilization for purposes other than treating ailment is additionally rising rapidly. On the residential showcase of Part States, around 500 modern dynamic chemicals are presented each year. These days, stimulants make up the larger part of these, taken after by manufactured cannabinoid receptor agonists and a little number of opioids. NPS numbers have stabilized for the most part, but the proportions have moved. In 2014, opioid NPS made up fair 2% of all NPS found; by 2018, this extent had expanded to 9%. Overdose passing  from NPS opioids, numerous of which are fentanyl analogs, have been reported in North America and, to a lesser degree, abroad. Fentanyl is utilized in North America to create fake pharmaceutical painkillers or as a doping specialist for heroin and other substances like cocaine and methamphetamine.

In any case, information from Europe shows that manufactured cannabinoids are a critical issue for socially prohibited bunches counting the destitute and detainees. 22 countries detailed on the utilization of NPS in detainment facilities, and the lion's share of them cited manufactured cannabinoids as a noteworthy impediment. Forerunner chemical control compels drug makers to enhance, numerous substances that are as often as possible utilized as building squares for opiates counting amphetamine, methamphetamine, and \"happiness\" have been set beneath universal control.

Information from Mexico infers that this is often as of now the case: in Walk 2020, Mexico and the Joined together States detailed cost rises for methamphetamine due to deficiencies of forerunners provided from East Asia. The showcase is changing quickly In Central Asia and the Russian Alliance, manufactured substances are taking the put of sedatives From 2008 and 2018, it shows up that the sedative markets in Central Asia and the Russian League have moved. Whereas less individuals are getting treatment for opioid utilization, the number of sedatives reallocated by Russian League specialists has diminished by generally 80%. However it appears just like the doping industry is doing well.

Most jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis show a trend of increased cannabis use. Canada, Uruguay, and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use. In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has also been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use. In the two states that were the first to legislate in the United States, Colorado and Washington, the incidence of non-medical cannabis use among adults has increased, particularly in the past month, as well as the frequency of daily or almost daily use, which has exceeded the national average since 2012. All indicators show that cannabis use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, with usage nearly doubling last month. This indicates that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of cannabis. Short-term data from Canada also indicates that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased. However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained certain products from illegal sources. Is the sharp decline in global cannabis herb seizures due to the legalization of cannabis? In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decline in seizures in North America, which decreased by 84% over the past decade. In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world nearly doubled during the same period. The patterns of seizures indicate that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline. The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a restraining effect, but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of domestic regulation on new psychoactive substances. Some countries that have adopted different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show varying prevalence rates of their use. In some other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following domestic legislation. Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets, and medicinal opioids used for pain management and palliative care are primarily provided in high-income countries, with analgesics unevenly distributed across regions. In 2018, over 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries. About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania. The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the global population. It is estimated that the population of low-income and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but they consume less than 10% of the pharmaceutical opioids. The barriers to accessing pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices. Poorer individuals are at a higher risk of substance use disorders, with approximately 35.6 million people affected by such disorders in 2018. Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of substance use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. Research in high-income countries has confirmed this, showing that individuals' adverse socioeconomic trajectories—not just their status at a specific point in time—are also associated with the risk of substance use disorders. Substance use disorders can deepen socioeconomic disadvantages, further increasing the risks of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system. Women, ethnic minorities, immigrants, individuals from diverse sexual orientations, those displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and people in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by substance use disorders or encounter difficulties in accessing treatment services. According to estimates based on the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) metric, which measures the years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death, the harmful effects of substance use have intensified their broader social impact over the past decade. From 2007 to 2018, the global Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) attributed to substance use increased by 17%. The increase in disability-adjusted life years related to liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injection drug users, is particularly high—reaching 40%. The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, making it difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence. Limited data from around the world suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide. However, the role of alcohol in violent incidents appears to be greater than that of drugs. Although drug use may lead to crime, in some cases, this connection can be partially attributed to various mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risks, family environment, and peer influences. The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted. If there is an established criminal structure, large-scale organized crime activities, including international drug trafficking, may be carried out without violence. In the short term, the presence and degree of violence are less dependent on the quantity of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.

The larger part of these locales have seen a rise in cannabis utilize since legalization, be that as it may, other purviews without such enactment have moreover seen this design. Grown-up non-medical pot utilize has surged, particularly within the past month, and day by day or nearly every day utilize has surpassed the national normal since 2012 in Colorado and Washington, two of the primary US states to endorse laws. Numerous signs point to an upsurge in cannabis utilize in Uruguay since 2011, with utilization about multiplying within the past month. This appears that visit and standard cannabis utilize is the essential cause of the rise. Short-term information from Canada moreover demonstrate that a rise in utilization coincided with the legitimate market's development from 2018 to 2019. 40% of cannabis customers in 2019 in any case proceeded to buy certain merchandise from unlawful sources. Is the sharp decrease in worldwide seizures of pot herb due to cannabis legalization? Seizures of cannabis herb plunged to their least level universally in 2018 and had diminished by 84% over the past 10 a long time in North America. Seizures, in the mean time, about multiplied in other parts of the world over the same time span. Concurring to the seizure slant, directions pointing at liberalizing the pot showcase were a major figure within the drop. NPS control shows up to have a dissuasive impact, it is still challenging to assess the household control of NPS. The predominance of NPS utilize changes among a few countries with particular NPS administrative systems. With the sanctioning of household enactment, the utilize of NPS has diminished in different countries. Both the legitimate and unlawful sedate markets harmed defenseless bunches, pharmaceutical opioids are for the most part accessible in high-income countries for the treatment of torment and palliative care, territorial incongruities exist within the conveyance of torment mitigation. In 2018, high-income countries accounted for more than 90% of all medicine opioids that were accessible for therapeutic utilize. There are 2% in Oceania, 50% in North America, and 40% in Europe. The populace of these countries makes up around 12% of the complete world. In spite of the fact that moo- and middle-income countries are thought to be domestic to 88% of the world's populace, they as it were utilize 10% of all pharmaceutical opioids. Enactment, culture, healthcare frameworks, and endorsing hones are some of the numerous components that might make obstructions to getting to pharmaceutical opioids. A substance utilize clutter is more likely to develop in those who are less well off, In 2018, 35,600 thousand individuals were influenced by a substance utilize issue. Destitution, a need of instruction, and social prohibition may make substance utilize disarranges more likely to happen and decline their impacts. Thinks about in high-income countries have appeared that the likelihood of creating a sedate utilize clutter is additionally related with people's antagonistic financial directions, not as it were their status at a specific point in time. In expansion to compounding financial drawback, sedate utilize clutters can too increment the chance of unemployment, destitution, and vagrancy, making a horrendous cycle of drawback. These discoveries might moreover be associated to the criminal equity system's stigmatizing hones and results. Individuals in rustic zones, ladies, individuals of sexually assorted bunches, migrants, and individuals of ethnic minorities may too be excessively influenced by substance utilize clutters or have trouble getting to treatment offices. The disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) marker, which calculates the a long time of sound life misplaced to incapacity and untimely passing, demonstrates that the affect of destructive sedate utilize on society as a entirety has gotten more regrettable over the past ten a long time. Between 2007 and 2018, the number of worldwide disability-adjusted life a long time credited to medicate utilization rose by 17%. Untreated hepatitis C, which is predominant among infusing medicate clients, essentially expanded the number of DALYs (disease-associated mortality occasions) connected to liver cancer (up to 40%). It is challenging to set up all causal joins between the utilize of psychoactive substances and savagery since the relationship between drugs and savagery is complex. Inebriation may play a critical part in crime, agreeing to constrained information from around the world. In any case, it appears that drinking contributes more to savage occasions than do drugs. Sedate utilize may contribute to wrongdoing, but this interface may moreover be mostly clarified by a number of intervening variables, counting financial hardship and other sorts of difficulty brought on by individual hazard, family flow, and peer weight.

It is estimated that 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world. In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018. However, the associated harms of opioid drugs are often overlooked due to the smaller number of users. Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug use were attributed to these substances. The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis. In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the crisis of opioids is exacerbated by tramadol, while in North America, it is driven by fentanyl. These two regions have almost no commonalities in terms of economy, demographics, or general patterns of drug use, yet both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by substances that are easily accessible and low in production cost. In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years. In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths recorded in the United States involved fentanyl. Canada has also reported similar results, albeit with lower numbers. One reason fentanyl contributes to overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl in the illegal drug market. In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of tramadol has seen significant growth. In this region, there is an increasing number of patients using tramadol for treatment. In 2017, the global seizure of tramadol significantly increased, reaching a peak of over 125 tons. However, in 2018, following a new regulation on tramadol in India, the global seizure amount dropped to 32 tons. The crises in these two regions are driven by the ease of manufacturing and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation on tramadol and many fentanyl analogs or their precursors. What exacerbates the crises in these two regions is the availability of these substances in both the pharmaceutical and illegal markets, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse. The use of stimulants is continuously increasing. The stimulant field is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are seeing an increase in usage in their main markets. In 2018, approximately 19 million people used cocaine, as it is quite popular in North America and Western Europe. In the same year, approximately 27 million people used amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most widely used amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America. According to the majority of indicators available, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years. In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist and sometimes substitute for each other; when the usage of one drug increases, the usage of the other decreases, and at times both can increase or decrease simultaneously to meet the demands of the same market. COVID-19 has increased the risks for injection drug users. It is estimated that in 2018, there were about 11.3 million people who injected drugs, and approximately 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injection drug use. Over 1 million injection drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million have hepatitis C. In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug use, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most injection drug users with hepatitis C have not yet received treatment. The shortage of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs. As some users switch to injection or inject more frequently, more harmful methods of use may emerge.

Synthetic opioid abuse worsens public health crisis In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that is fueling the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The opioid problem is being exacerbated by easily accessible and inexpensively produced drugs in the two locations, which have little in common in terms of economics, demographics, or overall drug usage trends. A rise in opioid overdose mortality of 20 years has been attributed to the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl in North America. Fentanyl was involved in two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States in 2018. Canada reported similar results in smaller numbers. The variable potency of fentanyl on the black market for illicit drugs is one of the factors contributing to overdose deaths caused by fentanyl. Tramadol's non-medical market has seen tremendous growth in West, Central, and North Africa. Tramadol use disorders are being treated on a growing number of patients in the area. In 2017, the amount of tramadol that was seized internationally peaked at more than 125 tons. Global seizures, however, dropped to 32 tons in 2018 when India implemented a new rule governing tramadol. The ease of production, low cost, and absence of international regulation of tramadol and several fentanyl analogs or their forerunners all contribute to the situation in both places. The availability of these medications in both prescription and illegal markets, which makes it more challenging to identify and stop abuse, exacerbates the situation in both locations. An increase in doping use Cocaine and methamphetamine, which both have rising use in their key areas, dominate the stimulant market. In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it is widely utilized in Western Europe and North America. In the same year, 27 million people took amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most popular ATS in North America and South-East Asia. Most indicators show that methamphetamine usage has been rising in both regions for the past 20 years. Cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist in some markets, occasionally substituting for one another, causing the use of one drug to climb while the usage of the other lowers, or occasionally both rising and falling to satisfy demand in the same market. COVID-19 increases risk for injecting drug users In 2018, it was projected that 11,300 thousand people used injectable drugs, and 10% of HIV infections worldwide are linked to injecting drug usage. HIV infects more than 1 million drug injectors, while hepatitis C affects 5,500 thousand. Half of the estimated 0.585 million drug-related deaths in 2017 were attributable to liver illness brought on by hepatitis C, which is largely untreated among injecting drug users. 5 Users may substitute more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or combine opioids with synthetic narcotics as a result of opioid shortages brought on the COVID-19 regulations. Some users switching to injections or injecting more regularly may lead to the emergence of more hazardous patterns of usage.

The EU summit is embroiled in endless arguments over refugee policy, with EU officials stating that there are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process. [Global Times Special Correspondent in Belgium, Niu Ruifei] According to a report by AFP on February 10, during the latest EU summit that day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU leaders agreed to implement stricter policies on illegal immigration to facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants. According to reports, the EU's move is a response to the growing concern over the issue of illegal immigration in Europe. Currently, the core problem for the EU is that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported. According to the summit documents, EU leaders are calling on the Commission to \"immediately mobilize a significant amount of EU funds\" to strengthen external borders through means such as infrastructure and surveillance. However, the EU and its member states are embroiled in disputes over issues such as the payment for fence costs. Ursula von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the related costs. However, diplomats from some member states have stated that if the EU could share the costs of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external borders, it would free up national budgets for the countries and accelerate the construction process. The European Euractiv website reports that EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, and the limited reception capacity along with the overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting \"countless\" asylum applications across EU countries, putting the EU's refugee reception system in a state of near \"permanent crisis.\" According to estimates from the European Commission, Schengen countries in the EU received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the EU recorded over 330,000 illegal crossings last year. Against this backdrop, the summit also reached an agreement on a \"principle\" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants based on the court rulings of another member state. In addition, reports indicate that EU leaders also agreed to \"increase the use of the concept of safe countries,\" which will pave the way for the EU to establish a common list.

The global lithography giant ASML Holding in the Netherlands recently warned that the ban on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in semiconductor prices. U.S. media analysis indicates that after the U.S. government imposed harsh restrictions on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many American companies have been severely affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment producers, and the chip manufacturers themselves. The U.S. claims to suppress China's advanced semiconductor industry, but it has dragged the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain down with it. The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive sector that has long established a closely interconnected global semiconductor industry chain.

ASML, a leading manufacturer of lithography equipment worldwide, recently issued a warning that the Chinese export restriction on semiconductor production equipment would result in increased semiconductor pricing. US companies that make electronic design automation tools, chips, and wafer manufacturing equipment suffered greatly when the US government suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries. The worldwide semiconductor industry chain and supply chain have been negatively impacted by the alleged American suppression of China's sophisticated semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry is a high-tech, knowledge-intensive sector of the economy, and a globally interconnected chain of the semiconductor industry has long developed. Using specialized division of labor, experts estimate that the complete production process for semiconductor devices requires crossing international borders more than 70 times and takes 100 days. Although the US semiconductor sector has a solid base, its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in terms of modern manufacturing techniques, are relatively limited, and it mainly depends on East Asia. It is difficult to modify the geographical distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries, even when the United States makes every effort to direct advanced chip production and the supply chain to the regional development of the \"little circle\" led by the United States. The worldwide semiconductor industry has been seriously harmed by the United States' aggressive \"reshaping\" and \"de-Sinicization\" of the semiconductor industry chain. The foundation of the global future industry is the chip, and the growth of the chip industry depends on the involvement of all nations in the globe.

The United States has temporarily hampered the growth of China's semiconductor industry and associated sectors while also reaping substantial rewards.

The first batch of personal pension financial products is now on sale. There are 7 products available for selection from the family institution, with a minimum holding period of just 360 days. Personal pension financial products are finally online. On February 10, China Wealth Management Network released the list of the first batch of personal pension financial products, and 7 personal pension financial products from ICBC Wealth Management, ABC Wealth Management, and China Post Wealth Management were officially launched for sale. At this point, the \"shelf\" of personal pension accounts has finally gathered four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension financial products, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds. According to the introduction, the first batch of personal pension financial products consists entirely of publicly offered net value-type open-end products, including 5 newly issued products and 2 existing products. Except for 1 mixed product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed-income products. The Beijing Youth Daily reporter observed that among the 5 newly issued products, 4 are from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which are fixed-income products. The shortest holding periods are 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, with corresponding annualized performance benchmarks of 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, and 5.25% - 5.75%, respectively.

It will start fundraising on February 10 and end on February 19, with a risk level of Grade 2. Among the two existing products, one is the ABC Wealth Management \"ABC Tongxin · Lingdong\" 360-day technology innovation RMB financial product, which has a mixed investment nature and a risk level of Grade 3. The other existing product is \"Post Bank Wealth Tianyi · Hongjin No. 1,\" which is a fixed-income type.

The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks the official opportunity for personal pension investors to purchase wealth management products through their personal pension fund accounts. In November of last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the \"Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business by Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies.\" The \"Measures\" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension products through their personal pension fund accounts, including personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public fund products. Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Taxation Administration issued a notice clarifying that the personal pension system will be launched and implemented in 36 pilot cities and regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Xiong'an New Area, and Jinzhong City in Shanxi. As of the end of 2022, the number of participants in personal pensions reached 19.54 million, with 6.13 million contributors and a total contribution amount of 14.2 billion yuan.

Now that personal pension wealth management products have also come together, how should investors choose? Experts from the product development department of Bank of Communications Wealth Management stated that compared to other personal pension products, the pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products during the pilot phase have three main characteristics. First is stability, with a more robust risk management mechanism, more prudent investment strategies and philosophies, and the implementation of independent third-party custody that is not affiliated with the parent bank. Secondly, there is a long-term nature; the duration of the pilot phase pension financial products is all 5 years or more. The personal pension financial products to be issued next will have a minimum holding period of 1 year, with encouragement to hold for more than 3 years. Thirdly, there is inclusiveness; the purchasing threshold for the products is low, with the starting investment generally at 1 yuan, and some as low as 0.01 yuan. The rates for custody fees, management fees, and other charges are also more favorable. Professionals point out that investors should choose based on the characteristics of the products and their own risk tolerance. Personal pension savings have the characteristics of a longer duration, higher interest rates, and high safety, making them suitable for individuals with low risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection and are more suitable for those who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns; on the other hand, personal pension financial products and public mutual fund products do not guarantee principal or returns, carry certain investment risks, but offer higher expected returns, making them suitable for individuals with a certain level of financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

Another large gym \"explodes\"? Recently, the issue of member rights protection at the well-known fitness organization Zhongjian Fitness has attracted social attention. After the Spring Festival, many members found that their local branches were not operating normally, which led to rumors of the organization closing down and fleeing, causing panic among members and prompting intervention from the public security and human resources departments. Finally, a relevant person in charge of the organization came forward to respond, promising to make efforts to protect the legal rights and interests of employees and members, which helped to calm the situation. Some branches of certain fitness institutions are experiencing operational issues and are temporarily closed. Consumers could calmly wait for the problems to be resolved, so why is the first reaction of many members \"this is serious\"? Behind the turmoil of gym club members defending their rights lies a deeper issue of trust crisis within the industry. Traditional gyms in the country generally adopt a prepaid model, and \"earning money without attracting users\" is the underlying logic of their development. By generating cash flow through the presale of membership cards and continuously opening new stores, it may seem like a cycle that can repeat, but in reality, it is living off borrowed resources and cannot establish a stable profit model. Frequent reports of gyms shutting down and other negative information about the industry have severely impacted consumer confidence. From the perspective of market prospects, gyms can certainly be considered a promising business with good financial potential. Although the fitness industry has its ups and downs, it has always attracted the attention of capital. Multiple data sources indicate that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption is continuously rising, and the market is steadily recovering. Specifically in the fitness market, as residents' living standards steadily improve and the concept of a healthy lifestyle becomes deeply ingrained, there is great potential for the development of the fitness industry. The better the situation becomes, the more the industry needs to focus on the quality of development. However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery in consumption; having just emerged from the crisis, they are already sounding the horn for expansion and pouring all their financing into the construction of new stores. It is undeniable that in recent years, many institutions have exited the market due to the impact of the pandemic, leading to a reshuffling of the industry. At this time, strong companies are selectively increasing their acquisition efforts and restructuring, which could be seen as a new opportunity. However, for the fitness market to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a stable and sustainable path, the industry must change its traditional models and adjust its business strategies. Only by steadily building trust and a sense of security among consumers can we truly win the market and secure the future. Compared to aggressively building new stores to capture the market, the fitness industry currently needs to focus on optimizing services and stabilizing users through high-quality development. First, we need to retain users through service. Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to a \"user-oriented\" approach, closely focusing on user needs and placing the operational emphasis on upgrading and improving service quality. Secondly, we need to enhance user experience through digital transformation. For example, the currently popular internet gym model allows users to pay per visit and choose their own venues. At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively utilized to meet social needs and achieve a complete service loop from online to offline. With no personal trainer sales pitches and no hefty annual memberships, users' concerns about fitness institutions \"running away\" have decreased, and their sense of trust has increased. In addition, we should actively explore diverse business formats. Nowadays, sports consumption has shifted from a single service to scenario-based consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Surrounding products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment needed for workouts may become new profit points, providing consumers with richer choices.

Recently, concerns over the protection of members' rights by the well-known fitness organization Zhongjian Fitness have garnered public attention. Members found their stores faulty since Spring Festival, group members panicked over rumors of closure, prompting intervention from safety, HR, and social security departments. In the end, the organization's relevant chief executive promised to make great efforts to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers and members, and the uproar died down. Fitness stores in financial trouble are closed for now, customers can be patient, \"Why is 'not good' common among members' responses?\" The crisis of industry trust is the root cause of the controversy surrounding the protection of fitness club members' rights. Conventional domestic gyms often use a prepaid model, and their evolution was motivated by \"making money from users who can't come.\" Although it appears that the process of generating cash flow by pre-selling membership cards and building additional locations on a regular basis may be repeated, it is actually hard to establish a sustainable business model. Consumer confidence is significantly impacted by the widespread distribution of unfavorable information about sectors like running in the gym. Of course, gyms might be seen as a good business with \"money potential\" from the perspective of market prospects. The fitness track has had its ups and downs, but capital has always been interested in it. Many statistics demonstrate that the market is still growing and that consumption in the arts, sports, and other professions is becoming more and more popular. With regard to the fitness market, there is a lot of room for growth given the steadily rising living standards of locals and the widespread acceptance of the value of a healthy lifestyle. The requirement for the industry to focus on development quality increases as the situation improves. Despite consumption recovery, some institutions were overly optimistic about the fitness market and invested all financing funds in new store construction. 5x5 The epidemic led to institutions withdrawing and business restructuring, big firms are restructuring and acquiring selectively, not a new opportunity. But, the sector must alter the conventional model and its business strategy if it hopes to enter a positive feedback loop and follow a steady and long-term course. We can only genuinely win the market and the future by working consistently and regaining the confidence and security of consumers. The fitness business needs to settle down to maximize services and stabilize users with high-quality development, as opposed to opening additional locations to capture the market. To keep users, it is first vital to rely on services. The essence of the service sector, which includes the gyms, is to uphold \"user orientation,\" pay special attention to customer needs, and improve service quality. To enhance user experience, second, rely on digital transformation. For instance, the current and widely used Internet gym model allows consumers to pay per view and select their own locations. Body data and sports data can be used to address societal demands and create a seamless closed-loop service from online to offline at the same time. Users are less concerned about \"running away\" from exercise facilities because there is no personal training promotion and no large annual card, and their sense of trust has also increased. Also, we need to actively investigate other business forms. Nowadays, watching sports is more like watching a scenario than just one service, fitness centers are anticipated to emerge as new points of access for consumers, sports gear and fitness equipment are examples of peripheral goods that could develop into new profit centers and give consumers more options.

Taipei, February 11 (Xinhua) - Export trade has seen \"five consecutive declines,\" the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has contracted for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has once again shown a \"3-digit\" figure... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023. Experts analyze that Taiwan's economy has performed poorly at the start of the year, facing significant growth pressure. According to the financial authorities of the Taiwan region, Taiwan's exports in January this year amounted to 31.51 billion USD, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth. The export value of 11 major export categories has declined compared to the same period last year. The decline in plastics, rubber, and their products, as well as optical instruments, is the steepest, with year-on-year decreases of 37.6% and 35.7%, respectively. The export of electronic components decreased by 20.1% year-on-year, marking the largest decline in 11 years. Among them, integrated circuits decreased by 18.3% year-on-year, marking the largest decline in 14 years. The head of the department's statistics office, Tsai Mei-na, stated that this indicates a spreading effect of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry, signaling that the electronics industry has entered a correction period. Statistics show that in January, Taiwan's imports and exports both declined, with a trade surplus of only 2.34 billion USD, the lowest level in nearly three years. The financial authorities of Taiwan believe that the decrease in global terminal demand and the industry's inventory adjustments are suppressing manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials, making it difficult to see an improvement in export trends in the short term. The decline in Taiwan's exports in the first quarter of this year is likely to be worse than expected. According to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Taiwan's manufacturing sector in January was 40.4%, a decrease of 3.3 percentage points from December of last year, marking seven consecutive months of contraction. In the economic monitoring indicator system, the PMI has a threshold of 50%; an index above 50% indicates economic expansion, while an index below 50% indicates contraction. In January, among the five components of Taiwan's PMI, new orders, production, and employment contracted, while supplier delivery times decreased and inventory tightened. All six major industries reported PMI contraction, with the industries ranked by the speed of contraction as follows: electrical and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optics industry (35.2%), chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation industry (42.6%), and food and textile industry (45.7%). In terms of prices, Taiwan's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics announced that the year-on-year CPI growth rate for January this year was 3.04%, once again surpassing 3% since July of last year. Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, reaching a 17-month high. Tsao Chih-hung, a special committee member of Taiwan's \"Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics,\" admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was indeed beyond expectations. Excluding the factors of the Spring Festival, the average CPI for January and February this year should be close to the 2.71% of last December, indicating that inflationary pressure still exists and remains at a high point. Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, experts express pessimism based on reports from domestic media such as the \"United Daily News\" and \"Yahoo Finance.\" Wu Da-ren, a professor in the Department of Economics at National Central University in Taiwan, analyzed that the decline in exports may lead to cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies, increasing the risk of debt defaults. At the same time, the decrease in orders has led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economies, which in turn impacts consumer spending power. Qiu Da-sheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States remains unresolved, and demand continues to shrink, estimating that Taiwan's export decline will extend into the first half of the year. Since Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, the sluggish export performance will result in weaker economic growth for the entire year compared to last year.

However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday brought immense relief to the search and rescue personnel. According to the Associated Press, in the hard-hit town of Nurdağı in Gaziantep Province, this family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days. Rescuers first pulled the mother and daughter out from a pile of rubble, and then found the father, who insisted that they rescue his son and another daughter first. When they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd. In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were successfully rescued under harsh and frigid weather conditions. \"What day is it today?\" \"——This boy, who was trapped under the rubble for 129 hours, asked the rescuers who saved him after being brought back to the surface.\" A man from Kahramanmaraş is holding his cat that has just been rescued. The miraculous successful rescue cases have brought a glimmer of hope to the search and rescue efforts, which were originally bleak; however, at the same time, the number of casualties continues to rise. According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has already caused over 20,000 deaths in Turkey, while the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be over 3,500. Although experts indicate that a person can survive for more than a week after being trapped under rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim. Rescuers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life beneath the rubble. Meanwhile, the focus of the rescue efforts has begun to shift towards helping the survivors who are in urgent need of assistance. UN officials: The region is facing a \"once-in-a-century\" disaster. Martin Griffiths, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, stated at a press conference in Turkey that this earthquake is the \"worst disaster in a century\" for the region. He also praised Turkey's response efforts after the disaster as \"extraordinary.\" He also told Reuters reporters that he hopes to provide aid to areas controlled by both the Syrian government and the opposition, but he also stated that the relevant matters are \"still unclear.\" The United Nations has committed to providing an additional $25 million in aid donations to the earthquake-affected population in Syria. Earlier this week, the United Nations announced the allocation of $25 million for disaster relief in Turkey and Syria. The most destructive earthquake in the world in the past 60 years. The Chilean Earthquake (1960) On May 22, 1960, at 3:11 PM local time, a magnitude 9.5 earthquake, the largest ever recorded in human history, struck Valdivia, Chile. In just ten minutes, the entire city of Valdivia was reduced to ruins. The massive tsunami triggered by the earthquake struck the Chilean coastline, generating waves as high as 25 meters. The tsunami affected distant Japan and the Philippines. The number of casualties and economic losses caused by such a widespread disaster cannot be accurately determined. The most destructive earthquake that has occurred globally in the past 60 years. The Alaska Earthquake (1964) March 27, 1964, was a Friday and also Good Friday. On this day, the largest earthquake in North American history occurred in Alaska, with a magnitude of 9.2. Until 2006, the Alaska earthquake remained the third largest earthquake in the world on record. At the time of the earthquake, a fault between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate ruptured near College Fjord in Prince William Sound. In most areas, the earthquake lasted for 3 to 5 minutes. The displacement of the seabed triggered a massive tsunami with a height of 67 meters. Since it was a holiday that day, the school and many businesses were closed. The earthquake ultimately resulted in the deaths of 139 people. Among them, 9 people died directly from the earthquake, while the other 130 died from the tsunami triggered by the earthquake. The most destructive earthquake that has occurred globally in the past 60 years. Tangshan Earthquake (1976) On July 28, 1976, two strong earthquakes of magnitude 7 or higher occurred in Tangshan and Fengnan County, Hebei Province, China, within a span of 16 hours. The epicenter is 23 kilometers below the surface. The entire city of Tangshan experienced disruptions in transportation, communication, water supply, and electricity, and was instantly reduced to rubble. The capital city of Beijing, 140 kilometers away, also felt strong tremors. According to official statistics, the earthquake caused 242,769 deaths and 164,851 serious injuries in all affected areas, including Beijing and Tianjin. The Tangshan earthquake became the second deadliest earthquake in recorded Chinese history, second only to the Jiajing earthquake of 1556. However, some overseas scientists estimate that this earthquake may have caused at least 650,000 deaths. The most destructive earthquakes that have occurred globally in the past 60 years. Indian Ocean Earthquake (2004) On December 26, 2004, an earthquake occurred 160 kilometers off the west coast of Aceh Province, Sumatra, Indonesia, with a depth of 30 kilometers and a magnitude of 9.1 to 9.3. The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami with wave heights reaching 15 to 30 meters. A total of 14 countries along the Pacific coast were affected, with the most severely impacted areas including Aceh Province in Indonesia, the coastal areas of Thailand, the resort island of Phuket, Sri Lanka, and the Tamil Nadu region in India. At that time, it was the peak tourist season for Christmas, and the affected areas were crowded with a large number of travelers and local residents, which led to many vacationers enjoying the beach and local workers by the sea being swept underwater by the tsunami, resulting in many people from this earthquake going missing. It is estimated that the number of casualties and missing persons is at least 300,000. The most destructive earthquakes that have occurred globally in the past 60 years. Wenchuan Earthquake (2008) On May 12, 2008, a major earthquake occurred in the Wenchuan area of Sichuan Province, China. According to data from the China Earthquake Administration, the surface wave magnitude of this earthquake reached 8.2, and the moment magnitude reached 8.3, with the affected area exceeding 100,000 square kilometers. As of September 25, 2008, the earthquake resulted in a total of 69,227 fatalities, 17,923 missing persons, 374,643 injured to varying degrees, 19,930,300 people losing their homes, and a total affected population of 46,256,000. It is the most destructive earthquake since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the deadliest one since the Tangshan earthquake. In March 2009, the State Council of China announced that May 12th of each year would be designated as Disaster Prevention and Reduction Day, to enhance public education and focus on disaster prevention and reduction efforts. Subsequently, governments in various regions of China and primary and secondary schools conduct earthquake drills on this day each year. Primary and secondary schools have also begun to emphasize the promotion of \"earthquake prevention and disaster reduction\" education. The most destructive earthquakes that have occurred globally in the past 60 years. Haiti Earthquake (2010) On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, an island nation in the Caribbean. The epicenter was located about 25 kilometers southwest of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, with a depth of approximately 13 kilometers below the surface. The International Red Cross estimates that approximately 3 million people were affected by the earthquake. The Haitian government has reported that the confirmed death toll exceeds 200,000. In some areas of Haiti, up to 90% of the houses were destroyed in the earthquake. Although the international community provided a significant amount of aid and support, this overpopulated and corruption-ridden impoverished country has never recovered from the disaster. The most destructive earthquake that has occurred globally in the past 60 years. The Great East Japan Earthquake (2011) On March 11, 2011, a large megathrust earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 occurred off the coast of the Tōhoku region in Japan. The epicenter was located in the Pacific Ocean east of Sendai, the capital of Miyagi Prefecture, with a measured depth of 24 kilometers, and it triggered a massive tsunami with a maximum height of 40.1 meters. This earthquake is the first recorded earthquake in Japan to exceed a magnitude of 9. Approximately 22,000 people lost their lives in the disaster, and about 400,000 buildings were completely destroyed or collapsed. The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant experienced a leakage incident due to the earthquake and tsunami. This incident was classified as the most severe level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). The Fukushima nuclear accident resulted in the detection of trace amounts of radioactive substances worldwide, including iodine-131 and cesium-137 (with a half-life of 30 years). A large amount of radioactive isotopes was released into the Pacific Ocean as a result of the nuclear accident. According to United Nations statistics, there are currently at least 870,000 people in the disaster areas of Turkey and Syria in urgent need of food. In Syria alone, up to 5.3 million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake. The World Food Programme (WFP) has called for a funding of 77 million dollars to provide food for the displaced victims in Turkey and Syria due to the earthquake. Currently, the temperature in the disaster areas has dropped to below zero, and many victims have no shelter. The Turkish government has distributed a large number of hot meals, tents, and blankets, but these supplies are still difficult to deliver to many people in urgent need of assistance. In Syria, which has been mired in civil war for 12 years, the earthquake has further exacerbated the suffering of the people. Within four days of the earthquake, the World Food Programme has provided food relief to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria. The World Health Organization (WHO) has sent 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma treatment and emergency surgeries.

Turkey and Syria, and hopes of finding survivors are fading, but the family of five rescued on Saturday was a great relief to searchers. The family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the hard-hit town of Nurday in Gaziantep province, the Associated Press reported. The rescue personnel first pulled the mother and daughter out of a pile of rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first. When they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd. In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, in harsh and cold weather conditions, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued. \"What day is it today?\" \"—The teenager who was trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the rescuers who rescued him after being brought back to the surface. A man from Kahramanmarash holds his newly rescued cat The miraculous successful rescue case brought a glimmer of hope to the previously bleak search and rescue operation, but at the same time, the number of casualties continues to rise. According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has resulted in over 20,000 deaths in Turkey, with an estimated death toll of over 3,500 people in neighboring Syria. Despite experts stating that a person can potentially survive for over a week when trapped under rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly bleak. Rescue workers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life beneath the rubble. Meanwhile, the focus of the rescue efforts has shifted towards assisting the survivors who are in urgent need of help. UN Official: \"Once-in-a-Century\" Disaster in the Region UN Deputy Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, stated in a press conference held in Turkey that this earthquake is the \"worst disaster in the region in a century.\" He also praised Turkey's post-disaster response as \"extraordinary.\" He also told Reuters reporters that he hopes to provide aid to both the Syrian government-controlled areas and the areas controlled by opposition forces, but he mentioned that the situation is still unclear. The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in humanitarian aid to the earthquake-affected population in Syria. Earlier this week, the United Nations announced a $25 million allocation for humanitarian assistance in Turkey and Syria for disaster relief. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years The Great Chilean Earthquake (1960) At 3:11 pm local time on May 22, 1960, the largest earthquake recorded by observations in Waldiva, Chile, in the history of human history, with a scale of the earthquake 9.5. In just ten minutes, the entire city of Waldivia became ruins. The massive earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami that struck the Chilean coastline, generating gigantic waves reaching a height of 25 meters. The tsunami spread to distant Japan and the Philippines. The exact number of casualties and economic losses caused by such a widespread disaster cannot be accurately determined. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years The Great Alaskan Earthquake of 1964 March 27, 1964 was a Friday, and it was also Good Friday. On this day, the largest earthquake in North American history occurred in Alaska, United States, with a magnitude of 9.2. Until 2006, the Alaska earthquake remained the third-largest earthquake in recorded history. During the earthquake, a fault line between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate ruptured near Prince William Sound, close to College Fjord. The earthquake in most areas lasted 3 minutes to 5 minutes. The displacement of the seafloor triggered a massive tsunami with a height of 67 meters. Because it was a holiday, schools and many businesses were closed. The earthquake killed 139 people. Nine people died directly from the earthquake, while the other 130 people died from the tsunami triggered by the earthquake. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years The Tangshan earthquake (1976) On July 28, 1976, two strong earthquakes with a magnitude of 7 or above occurred within 16 hours in Tangshan City and Fengnan County, Hebei Province, China. The epicenter was located 23 kilometers below the Earth's surface. The city's traffic, communications, water supply and power supply were interrupted and flattened in an instant. The capital city of Beijing, located 140 kilometers away, also felt strong tremors from the earthquake. According to official statistics, including the affected areas such as Beijing and Tianjin, the earthquake resulted in 242,769 deaths and 164,851 serious injuries. The Tangshan earthquake became the second deadliest earthquake in recorded history in China, with the highest death toll since the Great Shaanxi earthquake in 1556. However, some overseas scientists have estimated that the earthquake may have caused at least 650,000 deaths. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years Indian Ocean earthquake (2004) On December 26, 2004, an earthquake occurred 160 km off the west coast of Aceh Province, Sumatra Island, Indonesia, with a depth of 30 km and a moment magnitude of 9.1 to 9.3. The earthquake triggered massive tsunamis with wave heights ranging from 15 to 30 meters. A total of 14 countries along the Pacific Rim were affected, with the hardest-hit areas including Aceh Province in Indonesia, the resort areas of Khao Lak and Phuket in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Tamil State in India. It was the peak of the Christmas tourist season, and the affected areas gathered a large number of tourists and local residents, resulting in many tourists enjoying their holidays on the beach and locals working on the beach being swept to the bottom of the sea by the tsunami, making many people missing from this earthquake. It is estimated that the number of dead and missing persons is at least 300,000 people. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years Wenchuan Earthquake (2008) On May 12, 2008, a major earthquake struck the Wenchuan region in Sichuan Province, China. According to the China Earthquake Administration, the earthquake had a surface wave magnitude of 8.2 and a moment magnitude of 8.3, damaging an area of more than 100,000 square kilometers. As of September 25, 2008, the earthquake had caused a total of 69,227 deaths, 17,923 people missing, 374,643 people injured to varying degrees, 19.93 million people losing their homes, and a total affected population of 46.256 million people. It was the most destructive earthquake since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the one with the heaviest casualties after the Tangshan earthquake. In March 2009, the State Council of China announced that May 12 of each year will be designated as the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Day to strengthen public education and attention to disaster prevention and mitigation. Subsequently, governments and elementary and secondary schools in many parts of China hold earthquake drills on this day every year. Elementary and secondary schools have also started to pay attention to promoting \"earthquake prevention and disaster reduction\" education. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years Haiti Earthquake (2010) On January 12, 2010, the Caribbean island nation of Haiti experienced a magnitude 7.0 earthquake. The epicenter was located approximately 25 kilometers southwest of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, and the depth of the earthquake's focus was around 13 kilometers below the surface. The International Red Cross estimated that the population affected by the earthquake was approximately 3 million. The Haitian government has confirmed the death toll at more than 200,000. In some areas of Haiti, as many as 90% of houses were destroyed in the earthquake. Despite the significant amount of aid and support provided by the international community, this overpopulated, corruption-plagued, and impoverished country has never fully recovered from this disaster. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years The Great Tohoku Earthquake in Japan (2011) On March 11, 2011, a large thrust zone earthquake with a moment magnitude of 9.0 occurred off the coast of Tohoku, Japan. The epicenter was located in the Pacific Ocean east of Sendai City, the capital of Miyagi Prefecture, and the depth of the quake was measured at 24 km, causing a huge tsunami with a maximum height of 40.1 meters. The quake was the first earthquake with a magnitude greater than 9 in Japan's recorded history. Some 22,000 people were killed in the disaster, and about 400,000 buildings were completely destroyed or collapsed. The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant suffered a leak due to the earthquake and tsunami. This accident was classified as the highest level, level 7, on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES). The Fukushima nuclear accident resulted in trace amounts of radioactive substances being detected worldwide, including iodine-131 and cesium-137 (with a half-life of 30 years). As a result of the nuclear accident, a significant amount of radioactive isotopes was released into the Pacific Ocean. According to United Nations statistics, in the disaster-stricken areas of Turkey and Syria, at least 870,000 people are currently in urgent need of food. In Syria alone, as many as 530 million people lost their homes because of the earthquake. The World Food Programme (WFP) has called for $77 million in funding to provide food assistance to the displaced populations in Turkey and Syria affected by the earthquake. Currently, the temperatures in the affected areas have dropped to below freezing, and many displaced people do not have proper shelter. The Turkish government has distributed large quantities of hot meals, tents, and blankets, but these supplies are still struggling to reach many people in dire need. In Syria, which has been mired in civil war for 12 years, the earthquake has made the suffering of the people worse. Within four days after the earthquake, the World Food Programme has provided food assistance to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria. The World Health Organization (WHO) has delivered 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma care and emergency surgeries.

During the seminar, all participants were guided by Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, seriously studying the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party and General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the seminar. They engaged in in-depth discussions and exchanges related to practical issues, deepening their understanding of a series of significant theoretical and practical questions regarding Chinese-style modernization. This enhanced their confidence and determination to comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, as well as their sense of responsibility and mission to fulfill their duties, perform their work well, and ensure a good start for the new journey in the new era. At the graduation ceremony, 10 representatives from the seminar spoke and shared their learning experiences. Cai Qi stated that studying and implementing Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party is not only the primary political task at present and for the foreseeable future but also a long-term strategic task. It is necessary to promote the work of learning and implementation in accordance with the requirements of \"comprehensive learning, comprehensive understanding, and comprehensive implementation,\" ensuring that the efforts go deeper, become more practical, and resonate in the heart.

We must strive to master Marxist theory as a fundamental skill, consciously arm ourselves with the Party's innovative theories to guide our thinking, practice, and work. We should put effort into deep learning, careful understanding, and steadfast practice, truly cultivating firm beliefs, absolute loyalty, and a sense of mission. We must implement the decisions and deployments of the Party's 20th National Congress with a vigorous and proactive spirit, solidly advance Chinese-style modernization, roll up our sleeves and work hard, and take on the role of \"construction team leader,\" turning the blueprint into reality step by step. We must remember that the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party is always a work in progress, and the Party's self-revolution is also an ongoing journey. We should tighten and solidify the political responsibility for comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, with the Party's political construction as the guiding principle, and deeply promote the new great project of Party building in the new era. We need to enhance our abilities to promote high-quality development, serve the public, and prevent and mitigate risks, while vigorously fostering a spirit of investigation and research, and resolutely preventing and overcoming formalism and bureaucratism.

(Comprehensive report on the 11th) The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that the number of international visitors to Singapore is expected to reach 12 to 14 million in 2023, generating approximately 18 to 21 billion Singapore dollars in tourism revenue. The number of visitors and tourism revenue will recover to about 67% to 75% of the levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. There is a high likelihood of a full recovery for the tourism industry in 2024. The Singapore tourism market gradually restarted and recovered in 2022. The latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that inbound travelers in 2022 increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021, reaching 6.3 million, surpassing the tourism board's earlier estimate of 4 to 6 million. The number of visitors has recovered to 33% of the pre-pandemic level. From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled 8.96 billion Singapore dollars, and it is expected that the total tourism revenue for the entire year of 2022 could reach 13.8 to 14.3 billion Singapore dollars, representing a 6 to 7 times increase compared to 1.89 billion Singapore dollars in 2021, and recovering to about 50% to 52% of the level seen before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. The Singapore government is taking multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry. In April 2022, the government announced a funding of nearly 500 million Singapore dollars to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry. The tourism board recently announced that it plans to allocate 110 million Singapore dollars from this budget over the next two years to launch more commercial and recreational activities to attract tourists back. In order to make health and wellness one of the highlights of tourism in Singapore, the Singapore Tourism Board launched a request for proposals on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore. Wang Lingli, the Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have prioritized physical health above all other considerations. Developing a health and wellness attraction in the Marina South area, which features Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism industry and economy, encouraging tourists to spend more and stay longer in Singapore. Singapore Tourism Board Director Chen Jianlong stated that health and wellness will become an important component of Singapore's tourism products in the coming years. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened public awareness and demand for physical and mental health. To this end, the tourism board has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists over the past two years. In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health and Wellness Festival, offering the public over 130 various health activities and experiences. Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences to tourists. In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, the Central Beach Market at Sentosa, the new \"Exploring New Frontiers\" exhibition hall at the ArtScience Museum, and the newly built outdoor theater at the Night Safari, the tourism board will support the development and updates of projects such as the Bird Park at Wildlife Reserves Singapore, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination. According to the plan, Singapore will establish relevant industry standards for the sustainable development of the meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (MICE) sector within 2023, focusing on improving waste management and carbon emissions, further optimizing the tourism environment. The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry. Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport has seen a strong recovery in passenger traffic, accommodating up to 150,000 passengers daily and approximately 1 million passengers weekly, which is about 75% of the levels before the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of aviation industry employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of pre-pandemic levels. Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore received 23.6 million passengers, which is 42% of the levels before the COVID-19 pandemic, with 170,000 flight takeoffs and landings, representing 53% of pre-pandemic levels. The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery of sectors such as accommodation, transportation, dining, and shopping. The Singapore government and the tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market. Koh Shuh Dan, Assistant Director of the International Division of the Singapore Tourism Board, stated that a survey by a Chinese travel platform shows that Singapore's safety index ranks among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is favored by Chinese tourists. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 3.6 million Chinese travelers visited Singapore each year for vacations. With China easing its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists this year could recover to 30% to 60% of the levels in 2019. Ke Shudan pointed out that the tourism bureau will closely monitor the signals released by China regarding outbound travel policies in order to respond to changes in tourist demand.

From a macro perspective, this data is influenced by many one-time and technical factors, such as the return of striking teachers, revisions in survey statistical criteria, and updates to seasonal adjustment factors, which may be subject to revision later (for reference, the non-farm payroll increase in January 2022 was revised down from 504,000 to 364,000). Non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data suggests. From a structural perspective, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still present, but it accounts for a relatively low proportion; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education, and healthcare have seen a significant rebound in new employment, indicating that there is still a labor shortage in the service sector. Combining the significant outperformance of the service sector PMI, the rebound in job vacancies and labor shortages, along with the strong consumer credit data, we assess that the U.S. service industry has entered a phase of rapid recovery following extreme weather and holidays. We believe that the tight supply and demand in the U.S. labor market is unlikely to improve without going through a recession. Currently, there is a supply gap of over 5 million in the U.S. labor market, and the labor force participation rate is rising slowly, especially for those aged 25 to 54, which is already close to the pre-pandemic peak. In addition, due to the excess savings of U.S. residents and the strength of consumer credit, the robust consumer demand will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the labor market. The ongoing tight supply and demand in the U.S. labor market will be the backdrop of the U.S. economy in 2023. Coupled with the nearing end of interest rate hikes and the ongoing fluctuations in inflation expectations, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth. Before the release of this data, the U.S. stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets had overly optimistic expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. As inflation data continues to improve, the Federal Reserve is not only shortening the pace of interest rate hikes but also maintaining a fragile balance regarding market inflation expectations. However, the market is ignoring the Fed's hawkish statements, not only expecting an early halt to rate hikes but also anticipating two rate cuts by the end of the year. In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market and the unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Federal Reserve's guidance on interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some harm to the market. Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth is unlikely to change the current trend of rapidly declining inflation. With M2 data turning negative year-on-year and various leading indicators of CPI gradually improving, U.S. CPI data has entered a phase of rapid decline since October. The persistence of wage growth will only provide a floor for future inflation data, making it difficult to falsify current market expectations. After the next inflation data is released, the market may enter a new round of speculation.

A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 nonfarm payrolls data, adding 517,000 new nonfarm jobs, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly earnings grew at a slightly slower rate of 4.4% year-over-year and 0.3% year-over-year. In terms of overall figures, this data may be influenced by several one-time and technical factors, such as the return of striking teachers to work, revisions in survey statistical methods, and updates in seasonal adjustment factors. There could be subsequent revisions to the data (as seen in January 2022 when the initial figure of 504,000 new non-farm jobs was later revised down to 364,000 jobs). Therefore, the non-farm employment situation may not be as robust as the data initially suggests. From the structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but it accounts for a lower percentage; new employment in high-touch services such as leisure and hotel, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and the data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry. Combined with the rebound in service industry PMI, job vacancies, and labor gap data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays. We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US job market will hardly improve without going through a recession. There is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor force participation rate is moving slowly upward, especially for 25-54 year olds, which is already near its pre-epidemic high. In addition, due to the strength of excess savings of American residents and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further lag the impact of tightening policies on the job market. The ongoing tightness in the US job market's supply and demand will be a prevailing characteristic of the US economy in 2023.

On February 11, the WeChat official account certified to Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Shanshan Holdings\") published an obituary. Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of Shanshan Holdings, passed away on February 10, 2023, due to ineffective treatment for a sudden heart disease, at the age of 65. In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. Following a transfer, in 1989, he became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd. In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Conference and the 22nd China Enterprise Future Stars Annual Conference, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand in the Chinese suit market reached as high as 37%. In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) was listed, becoming the first publicly listed company in China's apparel industry. Just as the apparel business was thriving, Shanshan Group began to transform, as Zheng Yonggang realized that \"once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and the possibility of Shanshan suits continuing to dominate and becoming the national attire for the long term is quite low.\" In 1999, Shanshan began to explore corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, \"We came to Shanghai to seek what exactly to transform into, specifically consulting many experts and scholars, continuously holding various strategic meetings and theoretical seminars.\" In the end, we established two major strategic directions. The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is big health with a promising future. After determining the strategic directions, Shanshan began to seek cooperation. At that time, the Carbon Research Institute of the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute was working on a national 863 project for Ansteel, but lacked sufficient research funding. Therefore, Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with the Carbon Research Institute of the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project \"Mesophase Pitch Microspheres,\" engaging in the research, production, and sales of anode materials, and achieving commercial promotion of anode materials in the domestic market. In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. achieved large-scale production of mesophase pitch microspheres, starting domestic substitution and replacing Japan as the main supplier of mesophase pitch microspheres in China. This is China's first manufacturer of lithium-ion battery anode materials, achieving the localization of lithium-ion battery anode materials. With the rapid proliferation of lithium battery applications, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s lithium battery business began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium materials business was incorporated into Shanshan's main operations, while the revenue share from the clothing business decreased year by year. By 2013, the revenue from Shanshan's lithium materials business had fully surpassed that of the clothing business. In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entering the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Shanjin Optoelectronics. This field has a relatively high technical content, and Shanshan's main competitors are all Fortune Global 500 companies, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko. Zheng Yonggang once shared his insights on post-investment management, stating, \"The success rate of private Chinese enterprises acquiring some high-tech companies internationally is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?\" \"Because everyone tends to consider, I spent so much money, I need to send someone to manage it, right? This is usually what people do.\" However, Zheng Yonggang was different. On the day of the successful acquisition, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shanjin Optoelectronics that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement a dual system for the company. In addition to Zheng Yonggang serving as chairman, Shanshan would not send its personnel to Shanjin, opting for an authorized management approach, while keeping the existing distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models unchanged. ICC Xinluo Information released the 2022 anode data, showing that Shanshan's anode shipments exceeded 200,000 tons in 2022, a year-on-year increase of 100%, with a market share of 16%. The shipment volume of artificial graphite anode materials ranked first for consecutive years. In the polarizer business, statistics from Yano Research show that Shanjin Optoelectronics, a subsidiary of the company, achieved a global market share of 29% in 2022, and it is expected that the market share will reach 32% in 2023, maintaining its position as the global leader. In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Co., Ltd. reported revenue of 15.841 billion yuan and a net profit of 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, the stock price of Shanshan Co., Ltd. was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan. On February 9, Shanshan Co., Ltd. stated on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphitization capacity was approximately 100,000 tons, and the graphitization capacity of the Meishan project was still in the ramp-up phase.

After the strategic direction was determined, Sugo started to look for cooperation, and at that time, the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute was doing the national 863 project for Anshan Iron and Steel, and the research funds were not enough, so Sugo and the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project \"intermediate phase carbon microspheres\" and engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, so as to realize the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China. In 2001, Suning Corporation achieved large-scale production of intermediate phase carbon microspheres and began domestic substitution, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate phase carbon microspheres in the domestic market. Indeed, this made Suning Corporation the first Chinese production enterprise for lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials, thus achieving the localization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials in China. With the rapid popularity of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugo began to develop gradually and In 2007, the lithium materials business was written into the main business of Sugo, and the revenue share of the garment business decreased year by year until 2013, the revenue of the lithium materials business of Sugo fully exceeded that of the garment business. In February 2021, Sugo successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer enterprise Sugo Gold Optoelectronics, which is a relatively high technology field, and Sugo's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, Nitto Denko. Zheng Yonggang has shared his insights on post-investment management, \"The probability of success of Chinese private companies acquiring some international high-tech companies is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail? Because everyone will go to consider, I spent so much money, I have to send people to manage, right, which is usually done an act \", however, Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of Sugo, Zheng Yonggang went to Sugo Gold Optoelectronics announced in public, Sugo as the majority shareholder of Sugo Gold, decided to implement a two-enterprise system, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, Sugo enterprise people are not sent to Sugo Gold, to adopt the way of authorized operation, the original distribution system, corporate culture, the management model remains unchanged. ICC Xinfern information released 2022 negative electrode data shows that the shipment of Sugo negative electrode in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, with a year-on-year increase of 100 % and a market share of 16 %, and the shipment of artificial graphite negative electrode material topped the list. In the polarizer business, according to Yano Research, the company's Sugene Optoelectronics will reach a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world. On the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Corporation revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, and on February 10, Shanshan Corporation share price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan On February 9, Suning Corporation stated on an interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite capacity was approximately 100,000 tons, and the graphite capacity of the Meishan project was still ramping up. According to Wind Information, Zheng Yonggang is still listed as the Chairman and actual controller of Suning Corporation. According to the SkyEye search, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1 % of the total equity of Sugo Holdings Co. The general manager of Shanshan Co Ltd is Li Zhihua, was born in 1968,he has successively served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co Ltd, Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co Ltd, Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co Ltd, and deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co Ltd.

Economic Observer Network reporter Chen Shan: Is the complexity of fund purchase channels making it difficult to consolidate account information? Always forgetting the \"little treasury\"? These issues faced by fund investors are about to be resolved. On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the \"Fund E Account\" app has been launched in various mobile app stores and is conducting a public trial run. According to the introduction, the \"Fund E Account\" provides a \"one-stop\" inquiry service for individual investors to access public fund account and share information, aiming to address the industry pain points of forgotten accounts and complicated inquiries faced by many small and medium-sized investors. According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were a total of 156 public fund managers in the country, managing approximately 26 trillion yuan in funds; there were 167 public fund share registration agencies and 411 public fund sales institutions. The account systems of various share registration agencies are independent of each other, lacking a unified industry query channel. Industry insiders have stated that by the end of 2021, there were over 720 million fund investors in China, meaning that half of the population nationwide had invested in fund products. Previously, investors needed to check their purchase status through different sales institutions, but with the \"Fund E Account,\" they can view the purchase status from all sales channels, making it clear at a glance what funds they hold. What is the \"Fund E Account\" app? According to relevant documents, the \"Fund E Account\" app is a mobile application developed and constructed by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It serves as a portal for the public fund industry, providing investors with a one-stop query service for the off-exchange shareholding status of all market public fund products. Investors can conveniently and quickly understand their holdings of off-exchange shares in public fund products from various fund managers purchased through all market sales channels via the \"Fund E Account,\" significantly improving query efficiency. Specifically, the information that investors can query through the \"Fund E Account\" includes: fund account information opened with various public fund managers in the entire market, trading account information opened with public fund sales institutions, and the off-exchange shareholding status of products held, including publicly offered securities investment funds and collective asset management plans managed by securities companies, which are not subject to the restriction of 200 investors. Liu Yiqian, the business head of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told reporters from the Economic Observer that investors can obtain a one-stop overview of all their off-exchange public fund holdings through the \"Fund E Account\" app. This helps them recover \"forgotten assets.\" More importantly, it consolidates comprehensive account information on fund investments for clients, enabling them to understand their investment status more timely, accurately, and completely, thereby better optimizing their fund portfolio allocation and planning their financial arrangements. How to register and use it? The reporter noted that the \"Fund E Account\" app is currently available on app stores for Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo phones, but the app is still in the public trial operation phase, and registration requires an invitation code, which investors can obtain by contacting the fund manager of the funds they hold. A customer service representative from a medium-sized public fund in Shanghai provided a six-digit invitation code to a reporter from Economic Observer and told the reporter, \"During the app's trial operation phase, China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation provides each fund manager with a certain number of invitation codes, and we will provide them to investors who call in to request one.\" After the trial operation ends, users will no longer need an invitation code to register. \" The reporter registered an account and completed the inquiry based on the relevant documents for downloading and using the \"Fund E Account\" published on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The entire process took only a few minutes and was mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry. After completing the real-name authentication step, the reporter clicked the \"Assets\" fund binding button, and all fund products purchased through various fund sales platforms were displayed in the binding options list (bindable accounts). Once the binding was completed, the total assets of the invested funds could be viewed directly, and the inquiry function could be used. It is worth noting that the \"Fund E Account\" only provides inquiry services for investors and does not facilitate subscription, redemption, or trading. The data date displayed by the \"Fund E Account\" is generally three trading days prior to the date the user conducts the inquiry (T day). For example, if you open the \"Fund E Account\" on February 10, the total assets, fund shares, and fund net value displayed on the assets page correspond to the date three trading days prior, which is February 7.

After the trial run is over, the invitation code will not be used when opening user registration. \" According to the official website of the Securities and Futures Commission, the reporter registered the account and completed the inquiry according to the documents related to the download and instruction of \"fund E account\", the whole process took only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.

On Saturday (February 11), French unions launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's pension reform proposal, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their opinions. This is the fourth day of action in the social movement opposing the government's pension system reform proposal. The number of people responding to the call for the rally may influence the unions' next course of action. This is the fourth nationwide mobilization jointly initiated by the eight major trade union groups in France in a month, and it is also the first time that the protest activities have been scheduled for Saturday. Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people, they do not have to choose between participating in the protest or losing wages due to a strike, the union groups hope that today's gathering will attract more participants. The unions of the public transportation system, the subway, and the public railway companies have not called for a strike today, so the public transport system should operate normally, allowing citizens to take public transport to the gathering location. Meanwhile, in areas where schools have started their winter break, people can go on vacation as usual. The union groups hope that more than one million people will participate in the gathering today, while the police expect the nationwide attendance to be between 600,000 and 800,000, with an estimated 90,000 to 120,000 people gathering in the Paris metropolitan area. Since the start of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support raising the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in the marches has gradually decreased. The first strike demonstration on January 31 gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people nationwide. The number of demonstrators on Tuesday (February 7) has already shrunk to between 750,000 and 2 million nationwide. This pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly. The opposition parties, especially those led by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendment proposals, causing the review process to progress very slowly. The debate between the ruling and opposition parties has also become increasingly intense and sharp. A member of the radical left-wing party La France Insoumise recently posted a picture on social media of themselves stepping on a balloon featuring the image of the Minister of Labor, which sparked protests from the ruling party. The President of the National Assembly ultimately announced a 15-day ban on the member from participating in parliamentary activities as a punishment for this behavior. Although this reform plan has sparked the largest social upheaval in France in over 20 years, the government has made only slight adjustments to the draft so far and has not made any significant concessions. The union is already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th, and plans to organize a demonstration on March 7th when the reform draft is submitted to the Senate for discussion.

This is the fourth time in a month that eight major French trade union groups have come together to launch a national mobilization, and the first time this protest has scheduled a rally on a Saturday. Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday and they don't have to choose between participating in a demonstration and protest or a wage garnishment strike, union groups are hoping that today's rally will attract more people. The unions of the public transportation system, the subway, and the public railroad companies are not calling for a strike today, the public transportation system should be able to operate normally and people can take the bus to the meeting place, while people can depart for their vacations normally in the areas where schools have started their winter vacations. Union groups are hoping for more than a million people to attend the rally today, while police expect the national turnout could be between 600,000 and 800,000, with 90,000 to 120,000 people likely to gather in downtown Paris. Since the beginning of this protest against the government's retirement reform plan, although opinion polls show that a majority of French people do not support the measure to raise the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets and participating in the demonstrations has gradually decreased. The first strike demonstrations on January 31 rallied between 1.27 and 25 million people across the country The demonstration on this Tuesday, February 7, saw a decrease in the number of participants, ranging from 757,000 to 2 million people nationwide. The retirement pension reform proposal is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly. The opposition parties, especially the ones led by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendment proposals, which have slowed down the deliberation process significantly. The debates between the ruling party and the opposition have become increasingly fierce and contentious. A member of parliament from the radical left-wing party France Unbowed recently transmitted a picture of himself on social media with a balloon with the head of the labor minister on his foot, sparking protests from the ruling party. The President of the National Assembly ultimately announced a 15-day suspension for the member of parliament, effectively barring them from participating in parliamentary activities, as a punishment for their conduct. Despite the widespread social unrest triggered by this reform proposal, which has been the largest in over two decades in France, the government has made only minor adjustments to the draft without making any significant concessions thus far. The unions are already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th, and are planning to organize demonstrations on March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion.

As part of the amnesty commemorating the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities released imprisoned dissidents Farhad Mesbahi and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelkhah on Friday, who had been on a hunger strike. Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a decree for amnesty, which includes some prisoners who were arrested during the recent anti-government protests. According to reports from the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters have been killed, including 71 minors. The report stated that 70 government security personnel have also been killed. It is believed that up to 19,763 protesters have been arrested. For several weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have been calling for a vote at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government. On the evening of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution on Friday night, state media showcased fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations, with people shouting \"Allahu Akbar!\" (God is the greatest!) However, many people at the rally could also be heard shouting \"Death to the dictator!\" \"Death to the Islamic Republic\" in videos posted on social media. On Saturday, the government television station broadcast live footage of official rallies from various provinces across the country. In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment were showcased. President Raisi's speech was frequently interrupted by the slogan \"Death to America\" — a hallmark chant at state rallies. The crowd also chanted \"Death to Israel.\" According to Reuters, Adelkhah, who has been imprisoned since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, which is a factor in the deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months. She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 for charges of national security offenses. They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison. Adelkhah denied these allegations. A week before Mesami was released, supporters warned that he faced a risk of death due to his hunger strike in protest. He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the mandatory wearing of headscarves. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday, calling for the restoration of her freedom, \"including allowing her to return to France if she wishes.\" \" ", "translation_split": ["Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution as hackers supporting the protests disrupt the president's televised speech.", "The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ebrahim Raisi's televised speech.", "The president's live televised speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, during which a group of anti-Iranian government hackers' logo appeared on the screen, identifying themselves as \"Edalat Ali (Justice for Ali).\"", "A voice was also heard shouting, \"Death to the Islamic Republic.\"", "According to a report by Reuters today, hackers interrupted the national television broadcast during Iran's anniversary of the revolution.", "Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, as President Raisi's hardline government faces the boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their resignation.

Since the strong earthquake occurred in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working tirelessly day and night in the ruins of thousands of collapsed buildings to rescue survivors trapped under the rubble. In the freezing temperatures, they often called for silence as they desperately tried to hear any signs of life from the piles of crumbling concrete. According to a report by Reuters today, two more women were rescued after surviving for several days in the earthquake rubble. However, the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 24,150. The death toll in Turkey is 20,665, while the number of deaths in Syria exceeds 3,500. The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday, along with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011 and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the earthquake in neighboring Iran in 2003. A similar strong earthquake that occurred in northwestern Turkey in 1999 resulted in the deaths of more than 17,000 people. Turkish authorities stated on Saturday that after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years, two women were trapped for 122 hours, and rescuers pulled them out from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey. Another injured 55-year-old man has been identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey. In the cold temperatures, rescuers often call for silence as they desperately try to hear any signs of life from the rubble of the crumbling concrete. In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering \"Inshallah\" — \"God willing\" — as they carefully reached into the rubble and rescued a 10-day-old newborn. He opened his eyes wide as the baby Yagiz Ulas, wrapped in a warm blanket, was carried to the field hospital. Video footage shows that the paramedics also took away his mother, who was dizzy and pale on the stretcher but conscious. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay informed reporters overnight that 67 people have been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and a total of 31,000 rescue personnel have been deployed in the affected areas. He said that approximately 80,000 people are receiving treatment in hospitals, while 1.05 million people are homeless due to the earthquake, crowded into temporary shelters. Due to the lack of food for many people in the cold winter conditions, public skepticism towards the two countries' leaders' response to the disaster relief is growing. According to Syrian state media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad visited a hospital in Aleppo with his wife Asma, reportedly marking his first trip to the disaster-stricken area since the earthquake. Earlier, the World Food Programme stated that its supplies in northwestern Syria, controlled by rebels, are running low due to the complexities of relief efforts caused by the state of war. On Friday, Erdogan visited the Adiyaman province of Turkey, where he acknowledged that the government's response did not meet expectations in terms of speed. Opponents seized on this issue to attack Erdogan, who is running for re-election in the vote scheduled for May 14, but it may be postponed due to the disaster. Reuters reported that the anger over the delayed provision of aid and the initiation of rescue efforts may impact the election. Even before the earthquake occurred, the vote was seen as the most severe challenge to Erdogan's two-decade rule. Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he referred to as a \"negative campaign for political gain.\" Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party, criticized the government's response.

Monday's 7.8-magnitude quake, which continued with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran. The strong earthquake that occurred in northwestern Turkey in 1999 resulted in the death of over 17,000 people. Rescuers have pulled two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours after the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, Turkish authorities said on Saturday. Another injured 55-year-old man has been identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the wreckage of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey. In the freezing temperatures, rescuers often appeal for silence as they strive to listen for any signs of life amidst the crumbling concrete rubble. In the Samandag area of Turkey, rescue workers crouched under a concrete slab, whispering \"Inshallah\" - \"God willing\" - as they carefully reached into the debris and pulled out a 10-day-old newborn baby. With wide-open eyes, the baby, Yagiz Ulas, was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to a field hospital for medical attention. Video footage shows that the paramedics also carried away his mother, who appeared dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but conscious and alert. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that in the past 24 hours, 67 people have been rescued from the rubble, and a total of 31,000 rescue personnel have been deployed in the affected areas. About 80,000 people are being treated in hospitals, he said, while 105 million people have been rendered homeless by the quake and are huddled in temporary shelters. Due to the lack of food for many people in harsh winter conditions, there is an increasing number of public questioning regarding the response of the two countries' leaders to the disaster. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad went to a hospital in Aleppo with his wife Asma, according to official Syrian media, it was reported that this was his first trip to the affected area since the earthquake. Earlier, the World Food Programme (WFP) stated that due to the complexities caused by the ongoing conflict, its stocks are running dangerously low in rebel-controlled northwestern Syria. On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adıyaman province, where he acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as expected. Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a May 14 vote that could be delayed by the disaster. According to Reuters, the anger over the delay in providing assistance and initiating rescue operations could potentially impact the elections. The handling of the disaster and the government's response will likely be a significant factor for voters to consider when making their decisions Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge in Erdogan's two decades in power. Erdogan called for unity and denounced what he called \"a negative campaign for political gain. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition party in Turkey, has criticized the government's response to the earthquake.

Mysterious and elusive, speculations abound. The U.S. military used the advanced stealth fighter jet F-22 again on Friday afternoon (February 10) to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska. The location where it was shot down is ten miles from the Alaskan coast. This is the second time the U.S. military has shot down an airborne object in less than a week. Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China was shot down over the waters near the coast of South Carolina after drifting in U.S. airspace for several days. The Pentagon stated that the second object shot down entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military while moving over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), and was roughly the size of a small car, much smaller than the previously shot down Chinese spy balloon. The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no evidence to suggest that the object was maneuverable. John Kirby, the National Security Council's Coordinator for Strategic Communications, stated on Friday that while the specific appearance of the high-altitude object is unclear, it \"poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation.\" Kirby stated that this object is different from the spy balloon found within the United States, as it did not have any \"payload\" hanging from it. Kirby said, \"Referring to it as an 'object' is the best description we can provide at this time.\" President Biden listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the object to be shot down, and he made this decision \"very cautiously,\" Kirby added. The U.S. officials' description of the object can be summarized as follows: it is roughly the size of a small car, has no control surfaces, no hanging apparatus, and flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters. However, this information still cannot answer basic questions, such as what this object actually is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out. Currently, many analyses and speculations online suggest that this may be another Chinese balloon. It may be similar to the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon drifting over Latin America, both of which could have originated from China, carrying out some kind of mission in different locations. Some people have also linked this \"object\" in Alaska to an \"unidentified flying object\" (UFO). A report from Newsweek quotes former U.S. Congressman Peter Meijer, who tweeted on Friday, \"I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO.\" \"The irony of confusing an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is quite surprising, but it is not worth sparking an interstellar conflict,\" Meijer said. Meijer sent out this tweet shortly after the Pentagon confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down. Newsweek reported that Meijer is not the only one who suspects that the object is a UFO.

Last Saturday, a Chinese surveillance balloon that had been circling the US airspace for days was shot down close to the South Carolina coast. The second downed item first entered U.S airspace on Thursday night, was followed by American military personnel as it flew across northeast Alaska, at a height of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), according to the Pentagon, the Chinese surveillance balloon that was earlier shot down is considerably smaller than the automobile, which is around the same size. Additionally, according to the Pentagon, there is currently no proof that the item is manipulatable.

Before deciding to send the object down, President Biden followed the Pentagon's counsel, a choice he made \"very carefully,\" according to Bryant. This object's official US description can be summed up roughly as follows: The flying height is around 10,000 meters, the size is comparable to a compact automobile, there is no joystick, and there is no suspension system.

Chinese customer service: We offer Chinese service, but since we are unsure whether you'll be sending it back to your own nation, we are unable to cover your shipping expenses.

In a lighthearted esports story, it’s remarkable that there isn’t a single character that one finds extremely annoying, which is a testament to the success of \"Full-Time\" in character portrayal. In terms of emotional lines, \"Full-Time\" also avoids the common criticism found in many web novels of having a harem filled with either beautiful women or overly dramatic relationships. The common thread among all the characters' feelings is their love for the game Glory, and most of them desire a fair and honorable victory. There are small schemes, but no major conspiracies; everyone seems so innocent and adorable. This may also be why there aren't any characters that are particularly annoying in \"Full-Time.\" The large IP of \"Full-Time\" is also thanks to this.

Regarding the emotional line, there aren't any of the 30 million harem beauties who are decried in common web publications, either they are gorgeous or they are evil, everyone's feelings are expressed in the complete language, and they all share the desire to triumph honorably and enjoy the game of glory.

The largest version is similar in size to the complete works of Michelangelo, measuring nearly 50 centimeters long and 34 centimeters wide; the medium version is approximately 36 centimeters long and 23 centimeters wide; while this version is the smallest and comes as a two-volume set with a slipcase. Personally, I find it acceptable. First, the price is affordable, and with over 700 pages divided into two volumes, it is easier to browse as a paperback. Second, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, which focus mainly on paintings, this book on Leonardo da Vinci features a majority of black-and-white sketches. For readers with a limited budget who are not art professionals, this version offers the best cost-performance ratio for appreciating both the artworks and the sketches. 2. The commentary on the painting section is excellent, with composition analysis, sketch analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper). However, I'm not sure if it's a printing issue or a problem with the book size, but some shadow areas are too dark, making it difficult to see the details, which is a bit regrettable. 3. Compared to Michelangelo's sketches, Leonardo da Vinci's sketches are much richer in content. The former is already a genius, while the latter's wide-ranging interests and high achievements cannot be described as merely genius. If before, one could only appreciate half of Leonardo da Vinci by looking at his paintings, after reading the sketches, one is left completely speechless.

In fact, the closer the relationship, the more appreciation and gratitude are needed, as this makes our lives better. Learning to appreciate can help companies retain talent to a certain extent and reduce turnover rates. We thank the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and the world.

On the evening of September 23, my wife's phone fell, and on a whim, I immediately ordered an 8P from Amazon. It was in stock, but it wasn't sold by Amazon directly and there was no price increase (which made me secretly happy). Since it wasn't fulfilled by Amazon, the shipping was relatively slow, and the system indicated that the latest expected delivery would be by September 27. My wife was really upset without her phone, so the next morning around 6 o'clock, she asked me to think of a solution. Later, I checked JD and saw that a 256GB model was in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I had to immediately order another one. With the new one purchased, I thought about canceling the Amazon order right away. Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to pick up the delivery in the early morning. I called customer service around 7 AM to request the cancellation of the order, and the customer service representative replied that it had been canceled and to wait for a text notification. Alright, I will wait patiently. When I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the \"not shipped\" status, so I immediately contacted customer service to request a quick cancellation of the order. The customer service representative replied that it had been processed successfully. By 3 PM, I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again and clearly inform them that this was my third call, requesting to cancel the order and to notify the seller not to ship it under any circumstances! The customer service representative contacted the seller at my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would need to wait until they were familiar with it before proceeding to cancel the order. However, they clearly told me that the seller is already aware and will definitely not ship the order, so please rest assured. When I checked the order on Monday, it surprisingly showed that it had already been shipped, and I was at a loss for words. Since I couldn't contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again. The subsequent handling was simply frustrating; basically, I had to tell them what to do step by step before customer service would take any action. The order is still in a delivery refusal status and is about to be dispatched again! Doesn't Amazon take the initiative to follow up on this? The selling company has already received the money, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.
