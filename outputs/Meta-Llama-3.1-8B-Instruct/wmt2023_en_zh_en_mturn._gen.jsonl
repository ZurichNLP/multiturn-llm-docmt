GB 18030-2022 4 Vocabulary 4.1 General This file contains characters that are single-byte, double-word, or four-byte encoded. The single-byte portion includes all 128 characters in GB/T 11383-1989, from 0x00 to 0x7F. 4.3 Double-byte part All of the graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, CJK unified Chinese characters, and portions of the graphic characters in GB/T 13000 are included in the double-byte component. In Appendix A, the characters in the double-byte section are listed. Among these, the Appendix B requirements must be followed for the graphics, code places, and functions of ideographic descriptors. Note:  The standard Chinese character encoding used in China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and other nations and regions is called GB/T 13000. Chinese characters with distinctive abstract glyphs are given their own code positions, while characters with the same abstract glyph but from various sources are given a similar code position. CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea, and the encoded Chinese characters are referred to as CJK unified Chinese characters or CCJK Unified Ideographs. 4.4 Four-byte part The text lists various Chinese characters in different standards, including GB/T 13000, .CJK unified character extensions A and C/D, and expansions. The characters in the four-byte section adhere to Appendix C's rules. 5 Overall structure The text uses hexadecimal notation for integers marked with a 0x, whereas decimal notation is used for values without a 0x. The appendix's codes are all expressed in hexadecimal, while decimal is used for all other values. The single-byte portion uses the GB/T 11383-1989 encoding scheme and the code points 0x00–0x7F. 1st byte: 0x81-0xFE, last byte: 0x40-0x7E, 0x80-0xFE double-word component uses two 8-bit binary strings for each letter. The coding range for the four-byte component is 0x81308130-0xFE39FE39, while the suffix used to expand the double-byte code is 0x30-0x39, which was not utilized in GB/Work 11383-1989. The first character of a four-byte character has an encoding range of 0x81-0xFE; the second character's range is 0x30-0x39; the third byte's range is 0x81-0xFE; and the fourth character's range is 0x30 A 0x39.

Double characters are ordered. The lower half of the double word's characters should be arranged in line with Appendix A. 6.3 The four-character brush's character arrangement There are 50400 code points in GB/T 13000 for single-byte characters, organized in the same order as the double-byte ones, Chars: 0x81308130 - 0x8439FE39.gly The 16 auxiliary planes of GB/T 13000 are represented by a total of 1,058,400 code bits from 0x90308130 to 0xE339FE39, and the character arrangement order is exactly in line with the equivalent code bit order of the 16 auxiliary planes of GB/I 13000. The four-byte part's character order must adhere to Appendix C. 7 Code point allocation 1. The single-character city part's code point allocation According to the guidelines in GB/T 11383-1989, the code points for the single-byte component are assigned. The distribution of single-byte code points is shown in Figure 2. Code distribution for double word section. The double-byte part's code bit layout is split into two sections with a combined 23940 code bits each: 0x8140-0xFE7E and 0x8180-0xFEFE.

A few sedate clients begun searching for less costly manufactured drugs amid the 2008 budgetary emergency, and their drug-using propensities changed to sedate infusion. Governments have moreover diminished financing for drug-related programs. Intercessions like medicate utilize and related hazard behavior anticipation and medicate treatment programs may be extremely hurt in the event that governments reacted to the show retreat within the same way. Additionally, interdiction endeavors and universal collaboration may get less consideration, which would make it easier for traffickers to conduct their commerce. Nations where noteworthy sums of opiates are snuck on commercial flights are expected to be most extremely affected. Some of the time in colossal amounts, dispatches transport engineered drugs like methamphetamine in masked carry-on packs or rucksacks. Since that limits on discuss traveler activity are being actualized essentially all over, the utilize of commercial flying for the transportation of drugs can be totally hampered. Regardless the disturbance of worldwide postal supply lines, there may be an upsurge within the trafficking of things by means of the mail and the dull web. The long-term impacts of the retreat and related lockdowns may cause the pharmaceutical industry to be disturbed. The destitute and powerless will be more slanted to utilize drugs hurtfully, create sedate utilize disarranges, and lock in in unlawful drug-related activities—whether generation or transportation—as a result of expanded unemployment and a need of openings. Sedate trafficking organizations might benefit from this circumstance by making a difference out distraught bunches and enrolling unused individuals to swell their numbers. These changes might effectively build up themselves as the modern typical in numerous places on the off chance that the government's capacity to reply is restricted. Development and Complexity Advertise development Showcase development is to some degree clarified by populace development designs Both the outright number of individuals utilizing drugs and the rate of the worldwide populace utilizing drugs have been rising. In 2018, there were an estimated 0.269 billion drug users, which is 5.3% more than there were in 2009, when there were an estimated 0.210 billion users, or 4.8% of the world's population of people aged 15 to 64. Sedate utilization has expanded altogether more rapidly in developing countries than in industrialized countries over the past 20 a long time. This to some degree reflects the reality that worldwide populace development amid the time shifted between industrialized and creating nations, at 7% and 28%, separately, but it moreover reflects the more youthful populaces in poorer nations developing more rapidly. Youthful individuals and young people account for the larger part of sedate clients. The populace of this age bunch expanded by 16% within the creating world between 2000 and 2018, whereas it shrank by 10% within the created world. One figure driving both the show and future pharmaceutical markets is urbanization Urban zones are more likely than country ones to have a sedate issue, both in created and creating countries. More than half of the world's populace presently lives in urban locales, up from 34% in 1960, and this colossal relocation from rustic to urban regions is to a great extent to fault for the common rise in sedate utilize. Urbanization may play a critical part within the dynamics of sedate markets within the future, especially in developing countries where urbanization is more articulated. Expanded riches is connected to an increment in medicate utilize, but the poorest individuals are most influenced by infection, medicate utilization is more common in created countries than in creating countries in general. Substances like cocaine are more closely connected to more princely districts of the world. Comparable to how it is among countries, medicate utilize is more common among the more rich areas of society. However, individuals with lower financial position move to substance utilize issues at higher rates. Moo pay and unsafe medicate utilize designs and conditions are related, agreeing to information from a little number of countries. These patterns appear to be less predominant among financial classes with more prominent riches. The risks for the foremost powerless people, such as medicate clients, are anticipated to be made more awful by the financial confinements forced by the around the world COVID-19 emergency. For occasion, the scourge has tossed tens of millions of individuals out of work universally and changes within the labor advertise, such as rising unemployment, have already been related to expanded sedate utilize. The pharma showcase seem develop encourage as a result of COVID-19, got to take chances and do illegal things. Due to COVID-19-related imperatives, there may have been an upsurge in trafficking by ocean since it is less likely to be catching and can carry greater volumes of booty than arrive or discuss. There have recently been rumors of cocaine shipments traveling directly by sea from South America to Europe.

Few opioid users, unnoticed risks. 50 percent of the 21 million years of life thought to have been lost to drug-related disability or premature death in 2017 and 66 percent of the projected 167,000 deaths from drug use disorders were attributed to substances, Resulting from chemicals. Synthetic opioid abuse worsens public health crisis In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that is fueling the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The opioid problem is being exacerbated by easily accessible and inexpensively produced drugs in the two locations, which have little in common in terms of economics, demographics, or overall drug usage trends. A rise in opioid overdose mortality of 20 years has been attributed to the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl in North America. Fentanyl was involved in two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States in 2018. Canada reported similar results in smaller numbers. The variable potency of fentanyl on the black market for illicit drugs is one of the factors contributing to overdose deaths caused by fentanyl. Tramadol's non-medical market has seen tremendous growth in West, Central, and North Africa. Tramadol use disorders are being treated on a growing number of patients in the area. In 2017, the amount of tramadol that was seized internationally peaked at more than 125 tons. Global seizures, however, dropped to 32 tons in 2018 when India implemented a new rule governing tramadol. The ease of production, low cost, and absence of international regulation of tramadol and several fentanyl analogs or their forerunners all contribute to the situation in both places. The availability of these medications in both prescription and illegal markets, which makes it more challenging to identify and stop abuse, exacerbates the situation in both locations. An increase in doping use Cocaine and methamphetamine, which both have rising use in their key areas, dominate the stimulant market. In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it is widely utilized in Western Europe and North America. In the same year, 27 million people took amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most popular ATS in North America and South-East Asia. Most indicators show that methamphetamine usage has been rising in both regions for the past 20 years. Cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist in some markets, occasionally substituting for one another, causing the use of one drug to climb while the usage of the other lowers, or occasionally both rising and falling to satisfy demand in the same market. COVID-19 increases risk for injecting drug users In 2018, it was projected that 11,300 thousand people used injectable drugs, and 10% of HIV infections worldwide are linked to injecting drug usage. HIV infects more than 1 million drug injectors, while hepatitis C affects 5,500 thousand. Half of the estimated 0.585 million drug-related deaths in 2017 were attributable to liver illness brought on by hepatitis C, which is largely untreated among injecting drug users. 5 Users may substitute more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or combine opioids with synthetic narcotics as a result of opioid shortages brought on the COVID-19 regulations. Some users switching to injections or injecting more regularly may lead to the emergence of more hazardous patterns of usage.

Not long after the start of 2023, the US has been coming up with one bad move after another to curb China's development in the semiconductor-related industry. In recent years, the US has never stopped its actions to strike at China's \"core\" development, on one hand, it has been precisely suppressing China's semiconductor production and supply chain, and on the other hand, it has been building a \"de-China\" semiconductor industry chain alliance, aiming to completely \"shake off\" China in the advanced semiconductor industry. Whether it's by luring South Korea to form a \"technology alliance\", or by establishing a \"four-party alliance\" of chips with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or by using mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia \"quadrilateral mechanism\" and the \"Indo-Pacific Economic Framework\" to build a \"small circle\" of semiconductor industry supply chains, the US has been introducing politics, blocs, and militarization into the semiconductor industry, attempting to build a closed production and supply chain loop under US leadership, in order to make up for its weaknesses in chip manufacturing and maintain its advantageous position in the global chip industry. However, the US's grandiose \"chip war\" against China is also a case of \"harming oneself more than the enemy\". Recently, US well-known semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier Lam Research announced that it will lay off 1300 full-time employees due to the latest round of US export restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, and plans to lay off an additional 1400 temporary employees in the next two quarters. Global lithography machine giant ASML Holding of the Netherlands has recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China may lead to a rise in semiconductor prices. US media analysis suggests that after the US government's brutal suppression of China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have suffered greatly, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip design companies, semiconductor manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves. The US claims to be suppressing China's advanced semiconductor industry, but it has actually dragged the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain down with it. The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has already formed a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain. According to industry insiders, due to specialization and division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products requires crossing over 70 national borders and takes around 100 days. Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capacity, particularly in advanced process technology, and heavily relies on the East Asian region. Even if the US strongly guides the advanced chip production and supply chain to shift towards a US-led \"small circle\" regionalization, the global semiconductor-related industry's regional distribution and interdependence situation is difficult to be changed. The US's strong push to \"rebuild\" and \"de-China\" the semiconductor supply chain has severely damaged the global semiconductor industry. Chips are the core of the world's future industries, and the development of the chip industry cannot be achieved without the joint participation of countries around the world. In recent years, the US has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively enacting the \"Innovation and Competition Act\", the \"2022 US Competition Act\", and the \"Chip and Science Act\", using its technological hegemony to consolidate its technological lead; it has used a combination of carrots and sticks to pressure its allies, enticing Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the US, and has made every effort to ensure the US maintains its global leadership in the chip industry. In the short term, the US has indeed caused trouble for China's chip industry and related industries, and reaped real benefits. However, in the long term, the US's frantic suppression will force China's chip industry to continue breaking through, causing the US to lose a huge Chinese market, ultimately weakening the innovation willingness and innovation capabilities of US tech companies, and harming the development of the global chip industry.

US sanctions limit China's semiconductor industry and create de-Sinicization alliance, none - \"China\" is already the shortest possible version of its name. Whether it be to convince South Korea to create a \"specialized organization together,\" or to make a chip \"quadrate alliance\" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or to set up a semiconductor industry chain through components such as the \"four-party component\" of the Joined together States, Japan, India, and Australia, and the \"Indo-Pacific Financial System\". The US, however, also uses \"harm to the enemy by one thousand and self-injury by eight hundred\" as one of its \"fundamental tactics\" against China. The recent round of export restrictions on chip manufacturing equipment to China have caused the Lam Group, a well-known supplier of chip manufacturing equipment in the United States, to announce that it will be forced to lay off 1,300 full-time employees and 1,400 temporary workers over the course of the next two quarters. ASML, a leading manufacturer of lithography equipment worldwide, recently issued a warning that the Chinese export restriction on semiconductor production equipment would result in increased semiconductor pricing. US companies that make electronic design automation tools, chips, and wafer manufacturing equipment suffered greatly when the US government suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries. The worldwide semiconductor industry chain and supply chain have been negatively impacted by the alleged American suppression of China's sophisticated semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry is a high-tech, knowledge-intensive sector of the economy, and a globally interconnected chain of the semiconductor industry has long developed. Using specialized division of labor, experts estimate that the complete production process for semiconductor devices requires crossing international borders more than 70 times and takes 100 days. Although the US semiconductor sector has a solid base, its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in terms of modern manufacturing techniques, are relatively limited, and it mainly depends on East Asia. It is difficult to modify the geographical distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries, even when the United States makes every effort to direct advanced chip production and the supply chain to the regional development of the \"little circle\" led by the United States. The worldwide semiconductor industry has been seriously harmed by the United States' aggressive \"reshaping\" and \"de-Sinicization\" of the semiconductor industry chain.

Recently, concerns over the protection of members' rights by the well-known fitness organization Zhongjian Fitness have garnered public attention. Members found their stores faulty since Spring Festival, group members panicked over rumors of closure, prompting intervention from safety, HR, and social security departments. In the end, the organization's relevant chief executive promised to make great efforts to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers and members, and the uproar died down. Fitness stores in financial trouble are closed for now, customers can be patient, \"Why is 'not good' common among members' responses?\" The crisis of industry trust is the root cause of the controversy surrounding the protection of fitness club members' rights. Conventional domestic gyms often use a prepaid model, and their evolution was motivated by \"making money from users who can't come.\" Although it appears that the process of generating cash flow by pre-selling membership cards and building additional locations on a regular basis may be repeated, it is actually hard to establish a sustainable business model. Consumer confidence is significantly impacted by the widespread distribution of unfavorable information about sectors like running in the gym. Of course, gyms might be seen as a good business with \"money potential\" from the perspective of market prospects. The fitness track has had its ups and downs, but capital has always been interested in it. Many statistics demonstrate that the market is still growing and that consumption in the arts, sports, and other professions is becoming more and more popular. With regard to the fitness market, there is a lot of room for growth given the steadily rising living standards of locals and the widespread acceptance of the value of a healthy lifestyle. The requirement for the industry to focus on development quality increases as the situation improves. Despite consumption recovery, some institutions were overly optimistic about the fitness market and invested all financing funds in new store construction. 5x5 The epidemic led to institutions withdrawing and business restructuring, big firms are restructuring and acquiring selectively, not a new opportunity. But, the sector must alter the conventional model and its business strategy if it hopes to enter a positive feedback loop and follow a steady and long-term course. We can only genuinely win the market and the future by working consistently and regaining the confidence and security of consumers. The fitness business needs to settle down to maximize services and stabilize users with high-quality development, as opposed to opening additional locations to capture the market. To keep users, it is first vital to rely on services. The essence of the service sector, which includes the gyms, is to uphold \"user orientation,\" pay special attention to customer needs, and improve service quality. To enhance user experience, second, rely on digital transformation. For instance, the current and widely used Internet gym model allows consumers to pay per view and select their own locations. Body data and sports data can be used to address societal demands and create a seamless closed-loop service from online to offline at the same time. Users are less concerned about \"running away\" from exercise facilities because there is no personal training promotion and no large annual card, and their sense of trust has also increased. Also, we need to actively investigate other business forms. Nowadays, watching sports is more like watching a scenario than just one service, fitness centers are anticipated to emerge as new points of access for consumers, sports gear and fitness equipment are examples of peripheral goods that could develop into new profit centers and give consumers more options.

the Opening Ceremony of the Study Session on Learning and Implementing the Spirit of the 20th Party Congress Xinhua News Agency Commentator \"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systemic project, which needs to be integrated, systematically planned, and promoted as a whole, correctly handling a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy

on studying and implementing Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and the spirit of the 20th Party Congress for the new members and alternate members of the Central Committee and major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization and clarified in depth and systematically a series of major relationships that need to be dealt with in practice, providing a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization. Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves economic, political, cultural, social, ecological civilization and other fields, this is related to all aspects of governing the party, the state, the military, domestic and foreign affairs and national defense,  It is necessary to do a good job of systematic planning, but also the courage to reform and innovation, and constantly achieve overall advancement.

The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds tradition while pursuing innovation. To handle the relationship between righteousness and innovation, we should not only guard the origin, root and soul of Chinese modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese modernization, and ensure the correct direction of Chinese modernization, but also place innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, respond to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively identify changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously build new momentum and new advantages for development, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society. Efficiency is an important foundation for fairness, and fairness is a powerful guarantee for efficiency. As we advance Chinese-style modernization, we should not only strive to create higher efficiency than capitalism but also better safeguard social fairness, aiming to achieve a harmonious and mutually reinforcing relationship between efficiency and fairness. We should handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness well, continuously realizing that development is for the people, relying on the people, and the benefits of development are shared by the people, ensuring that the achievements of modernization benefit all people more and in a fair manner. Promoting China's style of modernization requires striking a balance between vitality and order, creating a society that is dynamic and vibrant while also maintaining stability and order. We should coordinate well the two major tasks of development and security, implement the overall national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the capability to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard the security of the country's political power, institutional security, ideological security, and key areas of security. We should consider security factors more in development, enhance national security capabilities through development, use the fruits of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, and create a favorable security environment for economic and social development, continuously stimulating development vitality, and achieving a virtuous interaction between high-quality development and high-level security. To advance China's modernization in a Chinese way, we must adhere to our own path while broadening our global perspective, persist in opening up to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of China's modernization. We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, placing the development of our country and nation on the foundation of our own strength, and firmly grasp the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands. We must continuously expand high-level opening-up, actively participate in global industrial division and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, broaden the development space of China's modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future through mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. Adhering to the right path is crucial for achieving long-term success.

However, a family of five who were rescued on Saturday brought a glimmer of relief to the rescue teams. According to AP, a family of five was rescued in Nurdağı town, a hard-hit area in Gaziantep province, after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days. Rescue workers first pulled out the mother and daughter from the rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted that his son and another daughter be rescued first. As they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd. In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in the harsh cold weather conditions. \"What day is today?\" \"——The 16-year-old boy, who had been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours, asked the rescue team that saved him when he was brought back to the surface. A man from Kahramanmaraş is holding his cat, which was just rescued. The miraculous rescue cases brought a glimmer of hope to the search and rescue efforts, which had seemed hopeless, but at the same time, the number of casualties continued to rise. According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has caused more than 20,000 deaths in Turkey, while the estimated death toll in neighboring Syria is over 3,500. Although experts say that people can survive for more than a week after being trapped under the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors is becoming increasingly slim. Rescue teams are still using thermal imaging equipment to search for signs of life under the rubble. Meanwhile, the focus of the rescue efforts is shifting to helping those survivors who are in urgent need of assistance. UN officials: The disaster in the region is a \"century's once-in-a-lifetime\" disaster. Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, stated at a press conference in Turkey that the earthquake is the \"worst disaster in a century\" in the region. He also praised Turkey's response to the disaster as \"unprecedented\". He also told Reuters that he hopes to provide aid to areas controlled by both the Syrian government and the opposition, but noted that the details are \"still unclear\". The UN has pledged an additional $25 million in humanitarian aid to the earthquake-affected areas in Syria. Earlier this week, the UN announced a $25 million allocation for disaster relief in both Turkey and Syria. The most destructive earthquake in the world in the past 60 years. The Chilean earthquake (1960). On May 22, 1960, at 3:11 pm local time, a massive earthquake occurred in Valdivia, Chile, which is the largest earthquake ever recorded in human history, with a magnitude of 9.5 on the Richter scale. In just ten minutes, the city of Valdivia was reduced to rubble. A massive tsunami triggered by the earthquake struck the coast of Chile, with waves reaching as high as 25 meters. The tsunami waves reached as far as Japan and the Philippines. The extent of the disaster and the exact number of casualties and economic losses are difficult to determine. The most destructive earthquake in the world in the past 60 years. The Alaska earthquake (1964) March 27, 1964, was a Friday, also known as Good Friday. On this day, a massive earthquake occurred in Alaska, the United States, which was the largest in North American history, with a magnitude of 9.2. Until 2006, the Alaska earthquake remained the third-largest earthquake in recorded history. At the time of the earthquake, a fault line between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate ruptured near the Prince William Sound, near College Fjord. In most areas, the earthquake lasted for 3 to 5 minutes. The displacement of the seafloor triggered a massive tsunami, with a height of 67 meters. Since it was a holiday, schools and many businesses were closed. The massive earthquake ultimately resulted in 129 people being killed. Among them, 9 people died directly from the earthquake, and the other 130 people died from the tsunami triggered by the earthquake. The most destructive earthquake in the past 60 years worldwide. The Tangshan earthquake (1976) On July 28, 1976, two powerful earthquakes of magnitude 7 or higher occurred in Tangshan City and Fengnan County, Hebei Province, China within 16 hours. The epicenter is 23 kilometers deep. The city of Tangshan was instantly flattened, with all transportation, communication, water supply, and electricity cut off. The capital city of Beijing, 140 kilometers away, also felt the strong tremors. According to official statistics, in all affected areas including Beijing and Tianjin, the earthquake resulted in 242,769 deaths and 164,851 injuries. The Tangshan earthquake became the second deadliest earthquake in recorded Chinese history, surpassed only by the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556. However, some overseas scientists estimate that the earthquake may have caused at least 650,000 deaths. The most destructive earthquake in the world in the past 60 years. The Indian Ocean earthquake (2004). On December 26, 2004, a 9.1 to 9.3 magnitude earthquake occurred 160 kilometers off the west coast of Aceh Province, Sumatra Island, Indonesia, at a depth of 30 kilometers. The earthquake triggered massive tsunamis with wave heights reaching 15 to 30 meters. A total of 14 countries along the Pacific coast were affected, with the most severely affected areas including Aceh Province, Thailand's Phang Nga and Phuket tourist areas, Sri Lanka, and the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the time, it was peak tourist season during Christmas, and the affected areas were crowded with tourists and local residents, resulting in many beachgoers and local fishermen being swept out to sea by the tsunami, making this earthquake one of the incidents with a large number of missing persons. It is estimated that at least 300,000 people were killed or went missing. The most destructive earthquake in the past 60 years worldwide. The Wenchuan earthquake (2008). On May 12, 2008, a major earthquake occurred in Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China. According to data from the China Earthquake Administration, the earthquake's surface wave magnitude reached 8.2, and its moment magnitude reached 8.3, with the affected area exceeding 100,000 square kilometers. As of September 25, 2008, the earthquake had resulted in a total of 69,227 deaths, 17,923 missing, 374,643 people injured to varying degrees, 199,300 people left homeless, and a total of 4,625,600 people affected. It is the most destructive earthquake since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the most deadly earthquake in terms of casualties since the Tangshan earthquake. In March 2009, the State Council of China announced that May 12th of each year would be designated as Disaster Prevention and Reduction Day, to strengthen public education and attention to disaster prevention and reduction work. After that, many governments and primary and secondary schools in China hold earthquake drills on this day every year. Primary and secondary schools also began to attach importance to popularizing \"disaster prevention and reduction\" education. The most destructive earthquake in the world in the past 60 years. Haiti earthquake (2010) On January 12, 2010, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake occurred in Haiti, a Caribbean island nation. The epicenter of the earthquake was located about 25 kilometers southwest of the capital city of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, at a depth of approximately 13 kilometers below the surface. The International Red Cross estimated that approximately 3 million people were affected by the earthquake. According to the official report by the Haitian government, the confirmed death toll exceeded 200,000. In some areas of Haiti, as many as 90% of the houses were destroyed in the earthquake. Although the international community provided a large amount of aid and support, the impoverished country plagued by overpopulation and corruption has never fully recovered from this disaster. The most destructive earthquake in the past 60 years worldwide. The Tohoku earthquake (2011) of Japan. On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 undersea megathrust earthquake occurred off the coast of the Tohoku region in Japan. The earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean, east of the capital city of Miyagi Prefecture, Sendai, with a focal depth of 24 kilometers, triggering a massive tsunami with a maximum run-up height of 40.1 meters. This earthquake was the first to exceed a magnitude of 9 in recorded Japanese history. Approximately 22,000 people lost their lives in the disaster, and around 400,000 buildings were completely destroyed or collapsed. The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant experienced a leakage accident due to the earthquake and tsunami. This incident was classified as a Level 7, the most severe, on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). The Fukushima nuclear accident led to the detection of minute amounts of radioactive substances worldwide, including iodine-131 and caesium-137 (with a half-life of 30 years), among others. Large amounts of radioactive isotopes were thus released into the Pacific Ocean as a result of the nuclear accident. According to the United Nations, at least 870,000 people in the affected areas of Syria are in urgent need of food. In Syria alone, as many as 5.3 million people have been displaced due to the earthquake. The World Food Programme (WFP) is appealing for $77 million to provide food to the displaced people in Turkey and Syria affected by the earthquake. The current temperature in the disaster area has dropped to below zero, and many displaced people are without shelter. The Turkish government has distributed a large number of hot meals, tents, and blankets, but the aid is still struggling to reach many people in urgent need. In Syria, which has been mired in a 12-year civil war, the earthquake has further exacerbated the dire situation of the people. Within four days of the earthquake, the World Food Programme has provided food aid to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria. The World Health Organization (WHO) has sent 72 tons of medical supplies for treating injuries and emergency surgery. (Associated Press, Reuters, etc.) (Copyright 2023 Deutsche Welle.

In just ten minutes, the entire city of Waldivia became ruins. The massive earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami that struck the Chilean coastline, generating gigantic waves reaching a height of 25 meters. The tsunami spread to distant Japan and the Philippines. The exact number of casualties and economic losses caused by such a widespread disaster cannot be accurately determined. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years The Great Alaskan Earthquake of 1964 March 27, 1964 was a Friday, and it was also Good Friday. On this day, the largest earthquake in North American history occurred in Alaska, United States, with a magnitude of 9.2. Until 2006, the Alaska earthquake remained the third-largest earthquake in recorded history. During the earthquake, a fault line between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate ruptured near Prince William Sound, close to College Fjord. The earthquake in most areas lasted 3 minutes to 5 minutes. The displacement of the seafloor triggered a massive tsunami with a height of 67 meters. Because it was a holiday, schools and many businesses were closed. The earthquake killed 139 people. Nine people died directly from the earthquake, while the other 130 people died from the tsunami triggered by the earthquake. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years The Tangshan earthquake (1976) On July 28, 1976, two strong earthquakes with a magnitude of 7 or above occurred within 16 hours in Tangshan City and Fengnan County, Hebei Province, China. The epicenter was located 23 kilometers below the Earth's surface. The city's traffic, communications, water supply and power supply were interrupted and flattened in an instant. The capital city of Beijing, located 140 kilometers away, also felt strong tremors from the earthquake. According to official statistics, including the affected areas such as Beijing and Tianjin, the earthquake resulted in 242,769 deaths and 164,851 serious injuries. The Tangshan earthquake became the second deadliest earthquake in recorded history in China, with the highest death toll since the Great Shaanxi earthquake in 1556. However, some overseas scientists have estimated that the earthquake may have caused at least 650,000 deaths. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years Indian Ocean earthquake (2004) On December 26, 2004, an earthquake occurred 160 km off the west coast of Aceh Province, Sumatra Island, Indonesia, with a depth of 30 km and a moment magnitude of 9.1 to 9.3. The earthquake triggered massive tsunamis with wave heights ranging from 15 to 30 meters. A total of 14 countries along the Pacific Rim were affected, with the hardest-hit areas including Aceh Province in Indonesia, the resort areas of Khao Lak and Phuket in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Tamil State in India. It was the peak of the Christmas tourist season, and the affected areas gathered a large number of tourists and local residents, resulting in many tourists enjoying their holidays on the beach and locals working on the beach being swept to the bottom of the sea by the tsunami, making many people missing from this earthquake. It is estimated that the number of dead and missing persons is at least 300,000 people. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years Wenchuan Earthquake (2008) On May 12, 2008, a major earthquake struck the Wenchuan region in Sichuan Province, China. According to the China Earthquake Administration, the earthquake had a surface wave magnitude of 8.2 and a moment magnitude of 8.3, damaging an area of more than 100,000 square kilometers. As of September 25, 2008, the earthquake had caused a total of 69,227 deaths, 17,923 people missing, 374,643 people injured to varying degrees, 19.93 million people losing their homes, and a total affected population of 46.256 million people. It was the most destructive earthquake since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the one with the heaviest casualties after the Tangshan earthquake. In March 2009, the State Council of China announced that May 12 of each year will be designated as the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Day to strengthen public education and attention to disaster prevention and mitigation. Subsequently, governments and elementary and secondary schools in many parts of China hold earthquake drills on this day every year. Elementary and secondary schools have also started to pay attention to promoting \"earthquake prevention and disaster reduction\" education. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years Haiti Earthquake (2010) On January 12, 2010, the Caribbean island nation of Haiti experienced a magnitude 7.0 earthquake. The epicenter was located approximately 25 kilometers southwest of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, and the depth of the earthquake's focus was around 13 kilometers below the surface. The International Red Cross estimated that the population affected by the earthquake was approximately 3 million. The Haitian government has confirmed the death toll at more than 200,000. In some areas of Haiti, as many as 90% of houses were destroyed in the earthquake. Despite the significant amount of aid and support provided by the international community, this overpopulated, corruption-plagued, and impoverished country has never fully recovered from this disaster. The world's most destructive earthquake in 60 years The Great Tohoku Earthquake in Japan (2011) On March 11, 2011, a large thrust zone earthquake with a moment magnitude of 9.0 occurred off the coast of Tohoku, Japan. The epicenter was located in the Pacific Ocean east of Sendai City, the capital of Miyagi Prefecture, and the depth of the quake was measured at 24 km, causing a huge tsunami with a maximum height of 40.1 meters. The quake was the first earthquake with a magnitude greater than 9 in Japan's recorded history. Some 22,000 people were killed in the disaster, and about 400,000 buildings were completely destroyed or collapsed. The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant suffered a leak due to the earthquake and tsunami. This accident was classified as the highest level, level 7, on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES). The Fukushima nuclear accident resulted in trace amounts of radioactive substances being detected worldwide, including iodine-131 and cesium-137 (with a half-life of 30 years). As a result of the nuclear accident, a significant amount of radioactive isotopes was released into the Pacific Ocean. According to United Nations statistics, in the disaster-stricken areas of Turkey and Syria, at least 870,000 people are currently in urgent need of food. In Syria alone, as many as 530 million people lost their homes because of the earthquake. The World Food Programme (WFP) has called for $77 million in funding to provide food assistance to the displaced populations in Turkey and Syria affected by the earthquake. Currently, the temperatures in the affected areas have dropped to below freezing, and many displaced people do not have proper shelter. The Turkish government has distributed large quantities of hot meals, tents, and blankets, but these supplies are still struggling to reach many people in dire need. In Syria, which has been mired in civil war for 12 years, the earthquake has made the suffering of the people worse. Within four days after the earthquake, the World Food Programme has provided food assistance to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria. The World Health Organization (WHO) has delivered 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma care and emergency surgeries.

The Singapore tourism market gradually restarted and recovered in 2022. The latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that the number of international visitors in 2022 increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million, exceeding the board's earlier estimate of 4-6 million, and tourists have recovered to 33% of pre-pandemic levels. From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled SGD 8.96 billion, and it is estimated that the total tourism revenue for 2022 will reach SGD 13.8-14.3 billion, a 6-7 times increase from SGD 1.89 billion in 2021, and has recovered to around 50-52% of the pre-pandemic level in 2019. The Singapore government has taken multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry. In April 2022, the government announced that it would allocate SGD 500 million to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry. The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that it plans to allocate SGD 110 million from the budget over the next two years to launch more business and leisure activities to attract tourists back. To make health and wellness a highlight of Singapore's tourism, the Singapore Tourism Board launched a call for proposals on November 23, 2022, to develop a wellness destination along the southern coast of Singapore. Singapore Tourism Board's executive director for sports and wellness tourism, Wang Ling Li, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have been prioritizing their physical health among their considerations. Developing a wellness destination in the southern coast area, which features the Marina Bay Gardens and Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism and economy, and encourage tourists to spend more and stay longer in Singapore. Singapore Tourism Board's CEO, Keith Tan, said that in the coming years, health and wellness will be a key component of Singapore's tourism product. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened public awareness and demand for physical and mental health. In response, the Singapore Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness initiatives to both local residents and international visitors over the past two years. In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board hosted its first-ever Health and Wellness Festival, offering over 130 health-related activities and experiences to the public. Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences to tourists. In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, the Siloso Beach Walk, the ArtScience Museum's new \"Explorations\" gallery, and the Night Safari's new outdoor amphitheater, the Singapore Tourism Board will also support the development and upgrading of attractions such as the Jurong Bird Park, making Singapore an attractive international destination. In line with plans, Singapore aims to establish industry standards for sustainable development of the meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE) and reward tourism industries by the end of 2023, with a focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions, further enhancing the tourism environment. The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry. Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Changi Airport has made a strong recovery, with daily passenger numbers reaching 150,000 and weekly numbers around 1 million, equivalent to about 75% of pre-pandemic levels, while the number of aviation staff on duty has also recovered to around 90% of pre-pandemic levels. Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore welcomed 23.6 million passengers, equivalent to 42% of pre-pandemic levels, and handled 170,000 flight movements, which is 53% of pre-pandemic levels. The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery of the accommodation, transportation, dining, and shopping sectors. The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market. Singapore Tourism Board's Assistant Director-General, Mrs. Koh Teck Ching, said that a survey by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore's safety index ranked among the top three globally, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is so popular with Chinese tourists. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, around 3.6 million Chinese tourists visited Singapore for travel each year. With China relaxing its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists this year will recover to 30% to 60% of the 2019 level. Mrs. Koh Teck Ching noted that the tourism board will closely monitor the signals from China's further relaxation of outbound travel policies to adapt to the changing needs of tourists. In addition to strengthening partnerships with online travel platforms such as Ctrip and travel agencies in China, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to welcome Chinese tourists by taking into account the new trends in outbound travel from China.

A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 nonfarm payrolls data, adding 517,000 new nonfarm jobs, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly earnings grew at a slightly slower rate of 4.4% year-over-year and 0.3% year-over-year. In terms of overall figures, this data may be influenced by several one-time and technical factors, such as the return of striking teachers to work, revisions in survey statistical methods, and updates in seasonal adjustment factors. There could be subsequent revisions to the data (as seen in January 2022 when the initial figure of 504,000 new non-farm jobs was later revised down to 364,000 jobs). Therefore, the non-farm employment situation may not be as robust as the data initially suggests. From the structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but it accounts for a lower percentage; new employment in high-touch services such as leisure and hotel, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and the data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry. Combined with the rebound in service industry PMI, job vacancies, and labor gap data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays. We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US job market will hardly improve without going through a recession. There is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor force participation rate is moving slowly upward, especially for 25-54 year olds, which is already near its pre-epidemic high. In addition, due to the strength of excess savings of American residents and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further lag the impact of tightening policies on the job market. The ongoing tightness in the US job market's supply and demand will be a prevailing characteristic of the US economy in 2023. Considering the impending end of interest rate hikes and the continuous fluctuations in inflation expectations, we are not optimistic about the sustained decline in wage growth. Prior to the release of this data, the US stock, bond, and currency markets had overly optimistic expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's path of interest rate hikes. As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed has continued to maintain the fragile balance of market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statements, expecting not only an early halt to rate hikes, but also two year-end rate cuts. In the case of tight labor market supply and demand, the impact of tightening policy is unknown, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance on rate hikes is relatively reasonable, the adjustment of extreme market expectations and the crowded trading may cause some harm to the market. Nevertheless, the stubbornness of payroll growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of each CPI sub-leading indicators, since October the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline in the phase, the stubbornness of payroll growth will only form the bottom of future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, the market may enter a new round of gaming after the next release of inflation data.

He once led China's first clothing stock to transform - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website Economic Observer reporter Zheng Yu Xin, On February 11, the WeChat public account certified as Sugi Sugi Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Sugi Sugi Holdings\") released a death notice, stating that Sugi Sugi founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Zheng Yonggang, died of a sudden heart disease on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65, after failing to receive medical treatment. In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the general manager of a state-owned cotton spinning mill. Following a transfer, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the general manager of Ningbo Yun Gang Clothing Factory, the predecessor of Sugi Sugi. In 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Conference and the 22nd China Enterprise Future Stars Conference, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the 1990s Chinese suit market, Sugi Sugi's market share once reached as high as 37%. In 1996, Sugi Sugi (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in the Chinese clothing industry. Just as the clothing business was thriving, Sugi Sugi Group began to transform, as Zheng Yonggang realized that \"once the market opens up, a tiered brand market for Chinese brands will naturally form, and it is unlikely that Sugi Sugi suits will continue to be the trendsetter and long-term become the national dress of the Chinese people.\" In 1999, Sugi Sugi began to research on corporate transformation, Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, \"We came to Shanghai, seeking to find out what to transform into, and we specially invited many experts and scholars, holding one after another Zhuge Liang meetings and virtual discussion meetings. Finally, we set two major strategic directions. The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is \"big health with a future\". After the strategic direction was determined, Sugi Sugi began to look for cooperation. At that time, the Carbon Institute of Anshan Thermal Power Institute, which was affiliated with Anshan Steel, was working on a national 863 project, and the research funding was insufficient. Therefore, Sugi Sugi and the Carbon Institute of Anshan Thermal Power Institute signed a cooperation agreement, jointly promoting the industrialization of the national 863 project \"mesophase carbon microspheres\", engaging in the research, production, and sales of negative electrode materials, and achieving the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China. In 2001, Sugi Sugi achieved the large-scale production of mesophase carbon microspheres, began to domesticize and replace imports, and replaced Japan to become the main supplier of mesophase carbon microspheres in China. This was China's first domestic producer of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials, achieving the domesticization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials. As lithium batteries rapidly became widely used, Sugi Sugi's lithium battery business began to gradually develop, and by 2007, the lithium battery materials business was included in Sugi Sugi's main business. The revenue from the clothing business gradually decreased year by year, until 2013, when the revenue from Sugi Sugi's lithium battery materials business surpassed that of the clothing business. In February 2021, Sugi Sugi successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizing plate business, entered the LCD polarizing plate market, and established the polarizing plate company Sugi Gold Electronics. This field has a high technical content, and Sugi Sugi's main competitors are all Fortune 500 companies, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Mitsui Chemicals, and Hitachi Chemical. Zhen Yonggang has shared his experience in post-acquisition management, \"The probability of success is relatively low for Chinese private enterprises to acquire high-tech companies abroad, why do some acquisitions fail?\" Because everyone would think, \"I spent so much money, I have to send people to manage it, right?\" This is a common behavior. However, Zhen Yonggang was different. On the day Sugi Sugi successfully acquired Sugi Gold Electronics, Zhen Yonggang publicly announced at Sugi Gold Electronics that as the major shareholder of Sugi Gold, he decided to implement a dual-management system. In addition to Zhen Yonggang serving as chairman, Sugi Sugi would not send people to Sugi Gold, instead adopting an authorized management approach, with the original distribution system, corporate culture, and management systems remaining unchanged. According to the data released by ICC Xinpu Information in 2022, Sugi's cathode output in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, with a year-on-year growth rate of 100%, and market share reached 16%. The output of artificial graphite cathode materials ranked first for the second consecutive year. In the polarizing plate business, according to Yano Research statistics, Sugi Gold Electronics, a subsidiary of the company, achieved a global market share of 29% in 2022, and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, maintaining its position as the global leader. In the first three quarters of 2022, Sugi Sugi's revenue reached 15.841 billion yuan, and net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, the stock price of Sugi Sugi was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan. On February 9, Sugi Sugi stated on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity was approximately 100,000 tons, and the production capacity of the Mianyang project was still in the ramp-up phase. According to Wandian, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Sugi Sugi. According to Tianyancha, Zheng Yonggang holds a total equity ratio of 40.1% in Sugi Holdings Limited. The general manager of Sugi Sugi is Li Zhihua, born in 1968.

Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nAlways forgetting the \"small treasury\"? Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nThese problems of the common people will soon be solved. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nOn February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the \"Fund E-account\" APP has been launched on various mobile app stores and is conducting a public trial operation. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nAccording to the introduction, the \"Fund E-account\" provides a \"one-stop\" query service for personal investors to check their public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve the pain points of account forgetfulness and cumbersome queries for the vast majority of individual investors. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nAccording to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there were 156 domestic public fund management companies, managing a total of approximately 26 trillion yuan in assets; there were 167 public fund registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nEach share registration institution has an independent account system, lacking a unified query channel across the industry. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nIndustry insiders have stated that by the end of 2021, there were over 720 million fund investors in China, which means that half of the country's population has invested in fund products. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nPreviously, investors needed to query their purchase situation through different sales institutions, but with the \"Fund E-account\", they can query their purchase situation across all sales channels, and their holdings are clear at a glance. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nWhat is the \"Fund E-account\" APP? Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nAccording to relevant documents, the \"Fund E-account\" APP is a mobile application for the public fund industry portal, approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which provides a one-stop query service for investors to check their holdings of public fund products across the entire market. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nInvestors can use the \"Fund E-account\" to conveniently and efficiently grasp their holdings of public fund products from various fund management companies across the entire market, purchased through all sales channels, and significantly improve query efficiency. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nSpecifically, the information that investors can query through the \"Fund E-account\" includes: account information of the fund accounts opened with various public fund management companies across the entire market, trading account information opened with public fund sales institutions, and holdings of publicly offered securities investment funds and other products, such as investment plans with more than 200 investors, managed by securities companies, in non-publicly traded shares. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nLiu Yi Qian, business director of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told an Economic Observer reporter that investors can use the \"Fund E-account\" APP to obtain a one-stop view of their entire holdings of publicly offered funds in non-publicly traded shares, helping them to recover \"lost assets\". More importantly, it has achieved comprehensive collection of fund investment information across all accounts, enabling clients to have a more timely, accurate, and complete grasp of their own investment situation, and thus optimize their fund portfolio configuration and better plan their financial arrangements. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nHow to register and use it? Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nThe reporter noticed that the \"Fund E-account\" APP has been listed on the app stores of Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and Vivo, but it is currently in a public trial operation phase, and registration requires filling in an invitation code. Investors can contact the fund management company of the funds they hold to obtain the code. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nA customer service personnel from a large public fund in Shanghai provided an Economic Observer reporter with a 6-digit invitation code and told the reporter that \"the APP is in a trial operation phase, China Clearing provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund management company, and we will provide them to investors when they call in.\" Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nAfter the trial operation ends, users will no longer need to use an invitation code to register. It seems like there is no Chinese text provided. Please provide the Chinese text you would like me to translate into English. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nThe reporter registered for an account and completed the inquiry based on the \"Fund E-account\" download and usage guide documents published on the China Securities Regulatory Commission's official website, and the entire process took only a few minutes, which mainly consisted of four steps: user registration, real-name verification, fund account binding, and inquiry of publicly offered funds. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nAfter real-name verification, clicking on the \"Assets\" binding button, all fund products purchased through various sales platforms appear in the binding option list (can bind accounts), and after completing the binding, the total assets of the invested funds can be directly viewed, and the inquiry function can be used. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nWhat's worth noting is that the \"Fund E-account\" only provides inquiry services for investors and does not allow for redemption, purchase, or sale. Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nThe data displayed on the \"Fund E-account\" is generally three trading days prior to the date of the user's inquiry (T day). Here's the translation of the Chinese text into English:\n\nFor example, when opening the \"Fund E-account\" on February 10th, the total assets, fund shares, and fund net value displayed on the asset page correspond to the date three trading days prior to that date, which is February 7th.

In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, Chiu Chun-shan, a senior advisor to the KMT's official National Government Foundation, commented positively on Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan that China welcomes green campers to visit the mainland as long as they agree with the \"1992 Consensus\" and oppose Taiwan independence. The (KMT) considers this evaluation as a new development. Earlier, when Xia Liyan met with Song Tao, there was no mention of this statement in the news on the same day. Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has for days clarified its refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus.

According to Zhao Chunshan also said that Wang Huning also personally gave instructions to Song Tao to say \"they (Taiwan farmers and fishermen) put forward the request, you must implement\", if the overall solution can not be adopted, but also to adopt a case-by-case approach.

retirement reform plan`1 On Saturday, February 11, the French labor unions launched another nationwide mobilization against the government's retirement pension reform draft, calling on the public to take to the streets and express their opinions. This is the fourth day of action in the social movement against the government's retirement pension reform draft. The number of people responding to the call for the demonstration will likely influence the next steps of the trade union groups' action plan. This is the fourth time in a month that eight major French trade union groups have come together to launch a national mobilization, and the first time this protest has scheduled a rally on a Saturday. Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday and they don't have to choose between participating in a demonstration and protest or a wage garnishment strike, union groups are hoping that today's rally will attract more people. The unions of the public transportation system, the subway, and the public railroad companies are not calling for a strike today, the public transportation system should be able to operate normally and people can take the bus to the meeting place, while people can depart for their vacations normally in the areas where schools have started their winter vacations. Union groups are hoping for more than a million people to attend the rally today, while police expect the national turnout could be between 600,000 and 800,000, with 90,000 to 120,000 people likely to gather in downtown Paris. Since the beginning of this protest against the government's retirement reform plan, although opinion polls show that a majority of French people do not support the measure to raise the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets and participating in the demonstrations has gradually decreased. The first strike demonstrations on January 31 rallied between 1.27 and 25 million people across the country The demonstration on this Tuesday, February 7, saw a decrease in the number of participants, ranging from 757,000 to 2 million people nationwide. The retirement pension reform proposal is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.

The president's live television address was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute when a group of anti-Iranian government hackers with the name \"Edalat Ali (Justice Ali)\" appeared on the screen. There was also a voice shouting \"Death to the Islamic Republic\" during the interruption. According to a report by Reuters today, during the commemoration of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, hackers interrupted the national television broadcast. As Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Laissez's hardline government faces its boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Laissez still calls on \"deluded youth\" to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader. Protests continue to sweep across Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September during her detention by the country's moral police. The Iranian security forces have been engaging in deadly crackdowns on the protest activities, marking one of the most significant challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979. Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on hunger strike as part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier issued an amnesty that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests. Human rights group HRANA reported that 528 protesters had been killed as of Friday, including 71 minors. Another 70 government security personnel were killed, the report said. It is believed that up to 19,763 protesters have been arrested. For the past few weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for a vote during Saturday's rally to demonstrate opposition to the protest activities and show support for the government. On Friday night, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media displayed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration, with people chanting \"Allahu Akbar! (God is the greatest!). \" However, many could also be heard at the rally shouting \"Death to the dictator! \" and \"Death to the Islamic Republic\" in videos posted on social media. On Saturday, the government television broadcasted live footage of official gatherings held in various states across the country.

President Laisi's speech was frequently interrupted by chants of \"Death to America,\" which is a common slogan heard during state gatherings. The crowd also shouted \"Death to Israel\" during the event. According to Reuters, Adelkhah, who has been imprisoned in Iran since 2019, is one of the seven French nationals detained in Iran, which has been a factor contributing to the deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months. She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security. Later, she was placed under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison. Adelkhah has denied the allegations. Just a week before his release, supporters had warned that Mesami was at risk of death due to his hunger strike protest. He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday and called for the restoration of her freedom, including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes. \" ", "reference_split": ["Pro-protest hackers hack president's televised address as Iran marks revolution anniversary", "The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi's televised address.", "The president's live television address was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute when a group of anti-Iranian government hackers with the name \"Edalat Ali (Justice Ali)\" appeared on the screen.", "There was also a voice shouting \"Death to the Islamic Republic\" during the interruption.", "According to a report by Reuters today, during the commemoration of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, hackers interrupted the national television broadcast.", "As Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Laissez's hardline government faces its boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Laissez still calls on \"deluded youth\" to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.", "Protests continue to sweep across Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September during her detention by the country's moral police.", "The Iranian security forces have been engaging in deadly crackdowns on the protest activities, marking one of the most significant challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.", "Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on hunger strike as part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution.", "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier issued an amnesty that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.", "Human rights group HRANA reported that 528 protesters had been killed as of Friday, including 71 minors.", "Another 70 government security personnel were killed, the report said.", "It is believed that up to 19,763 protesters have been arrested.", "For the past few weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for a vote during Saturday's rally to demonstrate opposition to the protest activities and show support for the government.", "On Friday night, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media displayed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration, with people chanting \"Allahu Akbar!", "(God is the greatest!). \"", "However, many could also be heard at the rally shouting \"Death to the dictator!", "\" and \"Death to the Islamic Republic\" in videos posted on social media.", "On Saturday, the government television broadcasted live footage of official gatherings held in various states across the country.", "In Tehran, as part of the official celebration, there were displays of domestically produced ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment.", "President Laisi's speech was frequently interrupted by chants of \"Death to America,\" which is a common slogan heard during state gatherings.", "The crowd also shouted \"Death to Israel\" during the event.", "According to Reuters, Adelkhah, who has been imprisoned in Iran since 2019, is one of the seven French nationals detained in Iran, which has been a factor contributing to the deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.", "She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security.", "Later, she was placed under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.", "Adelkhah has denied the allegations.", "Just a week before his release, supporters had warned that Mesami was at risk of death due to his hunger strike protest.", "He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.", "The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday and called for the restoration of her freedom, including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes.", "\""], "ref_token": 759, "translated_token": 1034, "token ratio": 1.3623188405797102, "bleu": 28.311719632271803}

the strong earthquake struck Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been tirelessly working day and night amidst the debris of thousands of collapsed buildings, striving to rescue survivors trapped under the rubble. In the freezing temperatures, they often appeal for silence, as they desperately try to listen for any signs of life amidst the crumbling concrete piles. According to a recent report by Reuters, two more women have been rescued after surviving for several days in the wreckage of the earthquake. However, the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 24,150 people. The death toll in Turkey stands at 20,665 people, while in Syria, it has surpassed 3,500 people. Monday's 7.8-magnitude quake, which continued with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran. The strong earthquake that occurred in northwestern Turkey in 1999 resulted in the death of over 17,000 people. Rescuers have pulled two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours after the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, Turkish authorities said on Saturday. Another injured 55-year-old man has been identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the wreckage of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey. In the freezing temperatures, rescuers often appeal for silence as they strive to listen for any signs of life amidst the crumbling concrete rubble. In the Samandag area of Turkey, rescue workers crouched under a concrete slab, whispering \"Inshallah\" - \"God willing\" - as they carefully reached into the debris and pulled out a 10-day-old newborn baby. With wide-open eyes, the baby, Yagiz Ulas, was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to a field hospital for medical attention. Video footage shows that the paramedics also carried away his mother, who appeared dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but conscious and alert. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that in the past 24 hours, 67 people have been rescued from the rubble, and a total of 31,000 rescue personnel have been deployed in the affected areas. About 80,000 people are being treated in hospitals, he said, while 105 million people have been rendered homeless by the quake and are huddled in temporary shelters. Due to the lack of food for many people in harsh winter conditions, there is an increasing number of public questioning regarding the response of the two countries' leaders to the disaster. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad went to a hospital in Aleppo with his wife Asma, according to official Syrian media, it was reported that this was his first trip to the affected area since the earthquake. Earlier, the World Food Programme (WFP) stated that due to the complexities caused by the ongoing conflict, its stocks are running dangerously low in rebel-controlled northwestern Syria. On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adıyaman province, where he acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as expected. Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a May 14 vote that could be delayed by the disaster. According to Reuters, the anger over the delay in providing assistance and initiating rescue operations could potentially impact the elections. The handling of the disaster and the government's response will likely be a significant factor for voters to consider when making their decisions Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge in Erdogan's two decades in power. Erdogan called for unity and denounced what he called \"a negative campaign for political gain.

Subsequently...it fell into the pit. This premise makes it seem like the entire book is rather carefree and joyful, because of Ye Xiu's blood in the first half, while Ye Xiu was still playing the online game, even the guild intrigue was not overly intense. Regarding the competition portion, I wrote about the passage of time and the juxtaposition of the old and modern with a hint of melancholy (maybe I am sentimental). I read the entire book in my second year of high school, which required a lot of study time, but I couldn't put it down. The character and emotional lines described in Full-time are truly wonderful, Some characters, who are only sporadically introduced, have a profound effect on the audience, for instance, Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng have a lot of followers since they are more concentrated characters, even the characters that are not part of the writing core, such Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu, are endearing, nobody can discover a particularly grating character in a cool piece on e-sports, this character description is a complete success. Regarding the emotional line, there aren't any of the 30 million harem beauties who are decried in common web publications, either they are gorgeous or they are evil, everyone's feelings are expressed in the complete language, and they all share the desire to triumph honorably and enjoy the game of glory. Everyone seems so innocent and adorable, and there are just little conspiracies. There might not be any unpleasant full-time jobs for this reason. This is due in large part to full-time IPs. Full-time is still a terrific book even when the cultural phenomena of internet writing is disregarded. He will essentially give a tiny touch and some hot blood. In April of this year, animation will be full-time.
